		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Crown and Bridges</h2>
Your teeth are susceptible to damage over time. For example, dental decay, traumas, wear, and tear, or even gum disease can cause this. You may have been born with a congenital disease that causes you to have missing teeth. You never know if the shape or size of your teeth may alter over time. Such conditions call for Restorative treatments like Dental Crowns &amp; Bridges.
<h2>What are Dental Crowns?</h2>
A dental crown is a long-term remedy since it covers and cements the visible portion of the tooth. Crowns act like a cap that covers a tooth's visible section.
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>One of the primary purposes is to improve a tooth's aesthetics while also improving its strength, usefulness, form, and size.</li>
 	<li>Bridges can maintain their position with the assistance of Crowns.</li>
 	<li>A crown is employed to secure the top of a dental implant.</li>
 	<li>If you've had root canal therapy, you should consider getting a crown to protect your site.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Necessity</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>To prevent a weaker or broken tooth from fracturing by keeping it together.</li>
 	<li>To replace a broken, outdated filling.</li>
 	<li>To repair a fractured tooth.</li>
 	<li>When teeth have been worn down, it is necessary to extend them (for example, from grinding).</li>
 	<li>To support a tooth with an ample filling and little natural tooth structure.</li>
 	<li>To modify for aesthetic purposes, such as filling gaps between teeth or reshaping or rotating teeth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Onlays &amp; ¾ Crowns:</h2>
For your teeth, there are a variety of crowns available. Onlays and 3/4 crowns cover fewer teeth than regular crowns. A typical crown will completely encircle your tooth, allowing you to eat and speak normally. You may want to consider Onlays and 3/4 crowns if you have a healthy tooth structure, as it covers only a part of your tooth. To prepare the tooth for a crown, your dentist will scrape away the decayed or damaged enamel only and then reshape the tooth.&nbsp;
<h2>Types</h2>
Different types of Dental Crowns are now available, which gives variety in functionality and appearance. However, your dentist will consider a few factors like crown placement, tooth visibility, gum tissue condition, and how much the dentist can save the original tooth before suggesting a specific type of dental crown.
<h2>What are Dental Bridges:</h2>
A dental bridge replaces lost natural teeth with prosthetic teeth composed of resin or porcelain. As the name implies, a bridge connects crowns on each side of a gap in the mouth to support prosthetic tooth replacement. The crown covers two or more teeth to attach the Bridge and artificial teeth. If you don't have natural teeth, your dentist may propose implanting teeth on either side.
<h2>Necessity</h2>
Missing teeth influence you in many ways. A dental bridge can help with:
<ul>
 	<li>teeth-whitening</li>
 	<li>improving chewing</li>
 	<li>speech restoration</li>
 	<li>maintaining your face's contour</li>
 	<li>readjusting your bite to disperse chewing power</li>
 	<li>preventing teeth from shifting from the correct location.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Care</h2>
Alternatives to Dental Bridges include Dentures and Dental Implants, albeit the best option for a particular patient will vary. Five to seven years is the average life expectancy of dental bridges. With proper dental care and regular expert cleanings, more than ten years may be possible. Flossing is crucial for maintaining your Bridge. Once-a-day flossing is the best approach to cleaning a bridge's bottom. When flossing a bridge, you must floss around your natural teeth and between the Bridge and gums.
<h2>Types</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Traditional Fixed Bridge: with two or more crowns and filler teeth in between.</li>
 	<li>Cantilever Bridge: with abutment teeth on one side. Resin-Bonded Bridge: Different material for missing tooth on front.</li>
 	<li>Implant-supported Bridge: dental implants in place of abutment teeth.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Which Is Better for You: a Dental Crown or a Bridge?</h2>
Crowns and bridges have distinct roles. A crown may be a preferable alternative if your tooth is severely decayed. However, a bridge is a superior option if you have missing teeth. However, the ideal decision is to consult your dentist about the most appropriate operation for your circumstances.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Orthodontics </h2>		
		<p>An alternative to conventional braces, Invisalign® is a system of transparent aligners that straightens your teeth over time.</p>		
			<h2>Orthodontics:
</h2>		
		Orthodontics:
Orthodontics is a dental specialty. It refers to the treatment of crooked teeth and malocclusions. An orthodontist is a dental specialist who works to straighten patients' teeth. The orthodontist may correct similar with teeth, jaws, and face as well. Treatment can be aesthetic, but it's also common to focus on improving a patient's dental health.
			<h5>Benefits:
</h5>		
		In addition to enhancing one's looks, orthodontic treatment provides further advantages. Improved self-esteem, improved chewing, clearer pronunciation and speech, reduced risk of dental caries, and lowered risk of gum damage and trauma from overbites and malocclusions are all significant benefits of orthodontic treatment. However, in some circumstances, treatment can lead to enhanced eating and speaking performance and assist in safeguarding teeth from injury or decay. — Medical and dental equipment such as headgear, plates, and braces help orthodontists achieve their objectives.
			<h5>Treatment Approach:
</h5>		
		Orthodontic therapy is often not initiated until most of a child's adult teeth have erupted. As a general rule, this occurs around 12 years old. There are fewer alternatives for orthodontic treatment for adults, but they can begin at any age. However, the number of adult teeth a child has erupted and the development of their face and jaws play a role in this.
Because orthodontic therapy can raise your risk of tooth decay and gum disease, you won't be able to begin treatment unless you maintain a high level of oral hygiene. Many appliances are used in orthodontic therapy to retrain muscles, slowly reposition teeth, and influence jaw growth by gently pressing teeth and jaw together.
			<h5>Aims: 
</h5>		
		Orthodontics can help treat a variety of dental issues, including:
Crowding: Poor alignment or crowding of teeth that are larger than the mouth's capacity results in an unappealing look and a bad bite. The upper canine teeth are the most typical to overlap.
Open Bite: When the bottom two front teeth do not touch the top two front teeth at any point while chewing results in an inability to chew properly.
Deep Overbite: The bottom teeth are so far forward in a deep bite that they contact the roof of the mouth, leading to damage to the gums and palate. Gum disease and tooth loss are possible consequences of this.
Crossbite: When the teeth's ends do not connect in a crossbite. It causes terrible looks, difficulty eating, and erodible teeth.
Increased Overjet: Thumb- or finger-sucking can cause this issue, which is an extension of the top teeth. The uneven development of the jawbone may be to blame.
Reverse Overjet: When the lower jaw extends beyond the upper jaw. In addition to a deficient physical look, it can cause tooth wear.
Spacing: Poorly formed, undersized, or absent teeth can cause gaps between teeth that appear unnatural.
			<h5>Orthodontic appliances:
</h5>		
		Appliances are used in orthodontic therapy to realign teeth. Following are the four most common options in practice:
Braces attached to the front of the teeth using brackets and wires are fixed braces.
Detachable Braces, which are plastic plates that attach to the teeth using clips, are restricted to minor tooth movements.
Removable Plastic Braces that fit both the upper and lower teeth and are linked together or intended to work together.
Other appliances may include headgear, aligners, invisible or lingual braces, lip and cheek bumpers, palatal expander splints, jaw repositioning appliances, etc. Ask your orthodontist which one of these will help your condition.
			<h5>Retainers: 
</h5>		
		When orthodontic treatment is complete, retainer comes into play. They keep teeth in their new positions while the gums and bones around them heal. They can either be detachable or permanent.
Your teeth may shift if you don't use your retainer anymore. It is typical for the location of your teeth to change during your lifetime. Wearing a retainer as instructed is the only method to ensure that your teeth remain straight.
			<h5>Clear Aligners/Invisalign®:
</h5>		
		<p>As an alternative to metal braces, Invisalign® is a transparent aligner system that is practically invisible, hence the name 'clear.' They're great for individuals with minor dental concerns or those who don't want to wear traditional braces.<br />It is possible to straighten your teeth with transparent, robust, medical-grade, non-toxic plastic aligners that are custom-made to fit you. "Invisible" aligners are used to shift the position of your teeth gently. Without the need for metal braces, this procedure corrects misalignment.</p>		
			<h5>Conclusion: 
</h5>		
		There are a wide variety of orthodontic procedures available. The optimal treatment for you will depend on the specific condition you are dealing with. Evaluating your existing dental situation and predicting how it will evolve is the first step in any procedure. Orthodontists use diagnostic techniques, including clinical examinations, dental models made of plastic, and X-rays, to establish a treatment plan which may offer several solutions to your situation.
It is understandable there is a lot to consider when deciding on a treatment plan for orthodontics. However, now that you understand what orthodontics is, why it's necessary, and how it works, we hope you're on your way to benefiting from it!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sedation Dentistry</h2>
Oral sedation commonly called as pill sedation refers to the use of tranquilizing medication to help the patient calm and relax before or during the dental process.&nbsp;

It involves the injection of sedative medicines through the mouth to reduce the patient's anxiety during a dental procedure.

The level of consciousness in oral sedation depends on the amount provided, which can be mild to moderate. The most common pill that is used for oral sedation is Halcion, it acts on the brain by turning down the part that regulates the fear and causes a calming effect to reduce anxiety. Halcion is used to cause mild sedation, while pills like Zaleplon and Lorazepam are used to cause moderate sedation. Moderate oral sedation causes drowsiness to such an extent that patients fall asleep throughout the entire treatment. Syrup like midazolam is also used for oral sedation for people who cannot take tablets.
Before performing the oral sedation, dentists check the patient's medical history and blood pressure to make sure that the patient is not at risk. Dentists prescribe two doses of medication to patients, one before the night of the procedure, which helps the patient to sleep peacefully, and one about an hour before the procedure.

After the procedure, patients that use oral sedation are not supposed to drive a car or travel by themselves because of temporary drowsiness and memory loss. Patients are advised to rest until the sedative medication wears off. Those who use Oral sedation, need 24 hours for a full recovery.

Oral sedation eases the anxiety and needle phobias and helps the patient to relax and be comfortable during the dental procedures. Many people who fear the orthodontic procedure are also afraid of needles, that are required when IV sedation is done however, in comparison oral sedation is preferred by most patients as it bypasses the use of needles. Oral sedatives are inexpensive for both the patient and the dentist when compared to other sedation options. There are no specialized procedures, equipment, or injections, and the dentist does not need substantial advanced training.

Oral sedation is typically safe, however, there are short-term risks like lingering drowsiness, dry mouth, mild headaches, nausea, and vomiting. People who have heart problems, respiratory disease, impaired kidney function, allergy to benzodiazepines, or are pregnant are not good candidates for oral sedation. Oral sedation is for people who have:
<ul>
 	<li>Dental fear.</li>
 	<li>People who have phobia of going to the dentist.</li>
 	<li>A gag reflex that is too sensitive.</li>
 	<li>People who have aversion to needles (aichmophobia).</li>
 	<li>People who have extreme sensitivity to the teeth.</li>
 	<li>It is also for those people who experience claustrophobia while sitting in the dentist chair’</li>
 	<li>People who cannot control movements during the dental procedures.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nitrous oxide sedation</h2>
Nitrous oxide, widely known as "laughing gas," is a safe and efficient conscious sedation treatment that can help patients relax, ease dental anxiety, and make certain dental operations simple and stress-free. Nitrous oxide can be used alone or in combination with other sedatives.&nbsp;

Nitrous oxide sedation is used for both adults and children. Nitrous Oxide is administered in combination with Oxygen, via a small mask or through a nose pin. Nitrous oxide is one of the safest sedatives in dentistry, and most patients handle it well. It is non-allergenic, has a quick onset, is reversible, and may be modified in various quantities. When breathing nitrous oxide/oxygen, the patient stays fully cognizant and retains all physiological responses.

Nitrous oxide is commonly known as the "laughing gas" because it sometimes causes euphoria and giddiness. Nitrous Oxide also enhances the pain threshold, making time seem to pass more rapidly. The effects of Nitrous Oxide wear off fast, usually within minutes of the gas being turned off. After a brief monitoring period at the office, adult patients who choose Nitrous Oxide during their dental procedures are allowed to drive themselves home or even return to work. Children are also monitored for a short amount of time before being free to resume their normal routine. Benefits of nitrous oxide sedation includes:
<ul>
 	<li>Nitrous oxide sedation is not harmful for the internal organs. It is extremely safe for lungs, brain, heart, and liver.</li>
 	<li>It is perfect for children and disabled people as it is a needless process</li>
 	<li>It works very fast</li>
 	<li>The effects of sedation wears of very quickly</li>
 	<li>Nitrous oxide sedation makes the dental treatments less painful.</li>
 	<li>The administration method of nitrous sedation is relatively easy.</li>
</ul>
During the procedure, the dentist regulates the amount of sedation patients receive and modifies the dosages as needed. The dentist gives the patient pure oxygen for at least 5 minutes after the procedure to flush the nitrous oxide out of the system and to avoid headaches. This helps patients to become more aware and conscious.

Nitrous oxide sedation is appropriate for people who:
<ul>
 	<li>Have a low pain threshold</li>
 	<li>Have needle fear or phobia</li>
 	<li>Those who have sensitive teeth</li>
 	<li>People with bad gag reflex</li>
 	<li>Require a large amount of dental work completed</li>
</ul>
Nitrous oxide sedation is usually safe when given by an experienced dentist it helps the patient to stay calm and comfortable throughout dental operations by reducing anxiety and phobias, however, certain people, such as those who are obese or suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, should consult a doctor before undergoing sedation. This is because they are more likely to experience anesthesia-related problems. Some short-term risk includes
<ul>
 	<li>Excessive sweating</li>
 	<li>Lingering drowsiness</li>
 	<li>Dry mouth</li>
 	<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
 	<li>Headache</li>
</ul>

The most common pill that is used for oral sedation is Halcion, it acts on the brain by turning down the part that regulates the fear and causes a calming effect to reduce anxiety. Halcion is used to cause mild sedation, while pills like Zaleplon and Lorazepam are used to cause moderate sedation. Moderate oral sedation causes drowsiness to such an extent that patients fall asleep throughout the entire treatment. Syrup like midazolam is also used for oral sedation for people who cannot take tablets.<br \/>Before performing the oral sedation, dentists check the patient's medical history and blood pressure to make sure that the patient is not at risk.

Night guards are dental appliances made of plastic that fit over top or lower teeth. They look very similar to dentures.

Night guards are also known as dental guards, mouth guards, or splint guards. Night guards are used for treating Bruxism. Teeth clenching and teeth grinding at night are known as bruxism, it causes mild to moderate jaw pain, gum recession, and facial pain. Night guards help to treat the mild bruxism.
Most bruxism cases can simply be treated by sleeping with a night guard on the teeth. They work by acting as a barrier between the upper and lower teeth and prevent the teeth from contacting each other. The night guards for teeth help to relieve pain while clenching the teeth, they also protect and buffer the muscles in the jaw. This buffering relieves jaw pain, and facial pain, and protects the tooth enamel.

Night guards are made up of soft plastic material that fits comfortably on the teeth. They are less costly and are easily obtainable without a prescription from the dentist. They are ideal for the treatment of mild bruxism; however, they are not the long-term solution for severe bruxism. Night guards are used by people who suffer from:
<ul>
 	<li>Teeth grinding</li>
 	<li>Jaw soreness</li>
 	<li>Tiredness from the lack of sleep</li>
 	<li>Headaches</li>
 	<li>Mild facial pain</li>
</ul>
Night guards are easily available in the market without the prescription from dentist and they can be bought from online retailer at a reasonable price.
<h5>Occlusal guards:</h5>
The term "occlusal" means the surfaces of the teeth that are used for chewing while eating. These surfaces are damaged by severe clenching and grinding of teeth, also known as the "Bruxism" while sleeping. Occlusal guards are used for treating severe bruxism and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) that cause intense facial and jaw pain, jaw soreness, headache, and tooth sensitivity.

Occlusal guards for teeth are removable dentures like appliances, they are like night guards but are made of hard acrylic plastic and are suitable for heavy and intense teeth clenching, and for TMJ. Occlusal guards protect the tooth surface and enable alleviating the symptoms related to bruxism and TMJ. The following are some signs that may indicate the necessity for an occlusal guard:
<ul>
 	<li>Severe teeth clenching and grinding</li>
 	<li>Intense discomfort and pain in the jaw</li>
 	<li>Loose teeth</li>
 	<li>Intense facial pain and feeling pressure in the cheeks</li>
 	<li>Disrupted pain</li>
</ul>
Occlusal guards are custom-made, and they are prescribed by the dentists. Many occlusal guards are only worn at night, although those who grind or clench their teeth during the day may benefit from wearing them during the day.
Occlusal guards would not prevent the person from clenching or grinding the teeth, but they can be a very effective solution to protect the teeth during the day or night for those who suffer from unconscious destructive oral habits.
<h5>- How are they made?</h5>
Occlusal guards are for people with teeth grinding difficulties and bite abnormalities. The devices are custom-made from vinyl, light-cured composite, soft acrylic, or resin made from heat-cured acrylic. The most durable and long-lasting bruxism night guards are those made of heat-cured acrylic. Softer materials are commonly used in occlusal guards for kids since their teeth and jaws expand.
<h5>- When to see the dentist?</h5>
For patients with flat teeth, an occlusal guard may be recommended by their dental professional during a routine checkup. If a patient wakes up with a headache, jaw discomfort, toothache, or lethargy, they should see a dentist. Grinding or clenching teeth can cause gum discomfort and possibly release teeth from their sockets; therefore, it's important to be aware of this.
<h5>- What to expect from the procedure?</h5>
If your dentist recommends that you get an occlusal guard, you may need to make two visits to the dentist before the final result is ready. The dentist will take a series of impressions of the patient's mouth. A dental lab will then use the impression to develop a custom-fit mouthguard for the patient.&nbsp;

The dentist will examine the fit of the guard on the second appointment and advise on how to use and maintain it. It takes a few weeks of consistent use of the occlusal guard for most patients to get accustomed to wearing it. Most patients find it easy to sleep while wearing a nightguard after acclimating. After the adjustment time, if the device continues to cause pain or discomfort, the patient may need to return to the dentist for modifications.
<h5>- How do they work?</h5>
Occlusal guards help protect the teeth from extensive wear and tear. It forms a barrier or cushion between the upper and lower teeth, slowing down the rate of surface degradation. When the jaw is relaxed, the force generated by clenching or grinding is lessened. As a result, the jaw joints will be protected, and the teeth will remain in good condition.&nbsp;

Although the night guard itself doesn't treat any condition, it serves as a safeguard against the more serious consequences of teeth grinding. If you ignore the signs, you risk developing more significant dental issues, such as tooth breakage or even tooth loss. In the long run, correcting these more significant concerns can cost more than the cost of an occlusal guard.

Using the occlusal guard is an effective measure that dentists recommend to prevent patients from grinding their teeth. Visit your dentist if you have any doubts about whether or not you need a nightguard.

Do you occasionally wake up with jaw discomfort or stiffness, a headache, sensitive teeth, or indicators that your teeth are moving or wearing away? If so, an occlusal guard may help. Occlusal guards, also known as night guards, mouth guards, bite guards, and dental guards, are removable devices that fit over the teeth. They may help you avoid problems like jaw discomfort, headaches, worn or damaged teeth, and much more. Noninvasive and effective occlusal guards are an excellent bruxer treatment choice.
<h5>Purpose:</h5>
The ultimate goal of a bite guard is to reduce grinding and clenching forces and avoid more damage and suffering. Clenching or grinding the teeth is something that many people do unconsciously at night when they aren't paying attention. A bite guard will not prevent clenching or grinding, but you may rest easy knowing that this device will safeguard your teeth from damage and relieve tension in your jaw muscles.
<h5>Working:</h5>
In the beginning, impressions of your teeth are taken, and they are then delivered to the laboratory, where a bite guard built just for you is created. The personalized bite guard is supplied two weeks later and adjusted for fit and function. A proper fitting is crucial for starters because an incorrect bite guard might aggravate an already problematic situation by making it much worse!
<h5>Necessity:</h5>
Symptoms help decide if you require an occlusal guard, like if:
<ul>
 	<li>You feel drained when you wake up.</li>
 	<li>You're prone to waking up with a toothache or a headache.</li>
 	<li>You have sleep apnea.</li>
 	<li>Your jaw muscles are painful, or you have joint discomfort in your jaw.</li>
 	<li>Your teeth begin to loosen, or you begin to experience discomfort in your gums due to clenching.</li>
 	<li>During a routine dental exam, your dentist observed your teeth had been crushed down.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT):</h1>
If you want the best periodontal care and comprehensive oral health, CBCT scans are an essential component. It’s a cutting-edge imaging technique with a wide range of potential uses in dentistry.&nbsp;
Dental and maxillofacial imaging have significantly benefited from the use of CBCT. CBCT radiation exposure is approximately ten times lower than traditional CT scans. However, because of its high level of accuracy, CBCT can offer volumetric data in three dimensions.
<h5>Working:</h5>
A 3D reconstruction develops the model of your teeth, mouth, jaw, neck, and ENT zone using the information gathered. The CBCT scanner spins around the patient’s head in dental and orthodontic imaging, capturing 600 unique views. In interventional radiology, the patient lies, so the region of interest is centered in the cone beam’s field of vision. A single 200-degree spin around the target region can yield volumetric data.
<h5>Benefits:</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Images that are clearer and more accurate.</li>
 	<li>Presents in-depth information regarding your dental health.</li>
 	<li>A pleasant and speedy encounter.</li>
 	<li>Radiation with a lower dosage.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Necessity:</h5>
Specifically, using this technology is critical to planning and executing a successful dental implant operation. The high resolution of a CBCT scan allows us to see your bones, nerves, and soft tissues in great detail, so we can evaluate your condition and formulate a treatment strategy before any surgery starts. This imaging assists the periodontist in:
<ul>
 	<li>Precise jaw measurements.</li>
 	<li>Diagnosing problems with the gums.</li>
 	<li>Finding blemishes that may signal illness.</li>
 	<li>Identifying the source of any discomfort you’re experiencing.</li>
 	<li>Examine the condition of your sinuses, nose, and nerve canal.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Panoramic X- Rays</h1>
Dental x-rays used in panoramic radiography, often known as “Panorex,” provide a two-dimensional (2-D) view of the entire mouth, encompassing both the upper and lower jaws and any surrounding structures or tissues.
<h5>Working:</h5>
Like a horseshoe, the jaw has a curved shape. On the other hand, the curving structure appears flat in the panoramic x-ray image. An x-ray exam aids in diagnosing and treating a wide range of dental issues.
Panoramic X-rays consume only a modest dosage of ionizing radiation to get images of the inside of the body. Patients must open their mouths to have an intraoral x-ray taken; however, with a panoramic x-ray, the film and detector are put within a machine. The patient is not required to open their mouths at all throughout the imaging process.
<ul>
 	<li>After an x-ray checkup, no radiation remains in the body.</li>
 	<li>Typical diagnostic X-rays have no adverse effects.</li>
 	<li>They come in handy while treating young children since the film doesn’t go inside the mouth.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Limitations:</h5>
A panoramic x-ray doesn’t show details about each tooth or soft tissue, including muscles. In most cases, it’s utilized to get a quick look at the teeth and bones. Because your mouth is curved, the panoramic x-ray may produce a little hazy image that does not allow exact measurements of your teeth and jaw.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Implant Dentistry</h2>
The field of implant dentistry is one of the most exciting and fastest-evolving in the dental industry today. Implantology is a relatively young field, despite its growing popularity.

During a three- to six-month healing period, a surgical device known as a Dental Implant is put into the jawbone and allowed to fuse with the bone. A dental implant serves as a substitute root when a tooth is lost&nbsp;
Teeth replacement restores the function and appearance of your teeth. Replacing lost teeth with Dental Implants is a terrific investment to get back to looking your best.
<h5>Preparation:</h5>
The planning process for dental implants may involve an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, a periodontist, a prosthodontist, or an ENT specialist. Getting ready for dental implants necessitates several surgical procedures, including one or more of the following:&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>A thorough dental examination: Your teeth and jaws may remodel using dental X-rays and 3D pictures.</li>
 	<li>A medical history review: Tell your doctor about any medical problems, medicines, and supplements you use. Your doctor may give you antibiotics if you have heart disease or orthopedic implants before your operation.</li>
 	<li>Treatment plan: This plan is tailored to your specific needs, considering the number of missing teeth and the health of your jawbone.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Procedure:</h5>
<h5>1. Dental Implant Placement:</h5>
Your oral surgeon cuts open your gum and bone during implant surgery. Holes are drilled into the bone to accommodate the dental implant post. Deep bone implants are necessary since they will function like tooth roots. You'll still have missing teeth. For looks, an implant of a temporary partial denture takes place. You can clean and sleep with this denture out.&nbsp;

Often, the dentist will extract any broken tooth at the implant location and operate for a bone graft, if needed. When adequate bone is available, a damaged tooth can be removed and implanted in the same session.
<h5>2. Osteogenesis:</h5>
The jawbone integrates with the implant's surface and develops into it during this time. Once the implant post is in, osseointegration occurs. This several-month process helps establish a stable framework for your new artificial tooth.
<h5>3. Abutment placement:</h5>
It's necessary to open your gums to see the dental implant. After osseointegration, the abutment tooth caps the dental implant, and the gum tissue is closed around it.
The abutment is visible over the gum line when you open your mouth until the dentist places the tooth prosthesis on it. The abutment is sometimes joined to the implanted metal post. That implies you won't have to do an additional surgical step. Although, the dentist can join the abutment in a separate appointment if the patient doesn't like how it looks.
Before attaching the prosthetic tooth to the abutment, your gums need to recover for two weeks.
<h5>4. Dental Prosthetics:</h5>
Once your gums recover, you'll get additional mouth and tooth impressions. You'll need these impressions to create the crown, which will be the visible part of your false tooth when it's finished. The dentist will cement the crown once the jawbone is strong enough to support a new tooth.

You and your dentist can pick from a variety of options for artificial teeth, including:

<b>Removable:</b> a partial or complete denture.

<b>Fixed: </b>an implant abutment is screwed or glued to a synthetic tooth.&nbsp;
<h5>5. Aftercare</h5>
Whether you undergo one or more dental implant surgeries, you may have swelling, bruising, pain, or minor bleeding. Dental implant surgery may require painkillers or antibiotics. Call your oral surgeon if swelling, pain, or other issues worsen following surgery. When recovering from surgery, you may need to eat soft foods. The doctor removes non-dissolving sutures.&nbsp;

Anesthesia options for surgery include local, sedation, and general. Your dentist can help you decide. Your dental staff will tell you what to eat and drink before the surgery, depending on your anesthetic. If you're sedated or under general anesthesia, prepare to be driven home and rested for the day.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Bone Grafting  &amp; Sinus Lifting</h2>
Bone Grafting is a procedure that restores bone density and volume to parts of the jaw where it has been lost.
There are three options for bone transplant material: autogenous (from own body), allograft (from another human's body), and animal tissue bank (xenograft). Bone transplant material may be synthetic in some cases (alloplast).
<h5>Procedure

Pre:</h5>
Your dentist will do an oral exam to determine the condition of your teeth, gums, and jaw. Dental X-rays or scans clearly show bone loss in the jawbone. After that, you and your dentist will talk about your treatment choices and develop a customized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.
<h5>During</h5>
First, your dentist will administer a local anesthetic to numb the region. An incision in your gums is the next step. Pushing back the gums allows for a clearer view of the jawbone. After washing and sanitizing the area, your dentist will put bone grafting material to the deficiency to heal it. A membrane is often placed over the bone transplant to provide further protection. The gum tissue is then realigned, and the cut is closed with stitches.
<h5>Post</h5>
You may have discomfort, inflammation, and bruising after a dental bone graft. Fortunately, these are only temporary adverse effects. Pain medications are effective in treating the symptoms. Additionally, your dentist may prescribe you antibiotics.

Like a grain of salt or sand, Bone pieces will begin to emerge from the wound in the first few days. Call your dentist to make sure you're recovering as predicted, even though this usually is not a problem.
<h5>Who needs a bone graft?</h5>
In most cases of jaw bone loss, dental bone transplants are necessary.
<ul>
 	<li>Having a tooth removed may need this treatment.</li>
 	<li>&nbsp;Plan to replace a lost tooth with an implant.</li>
 	<li>Before acquiring dentures, jaw reconstruction is crucial.</li>
 	<li>Suffer from gum (periodontal) disease that causes bone loss.</li>
</ul>
Bone Grafting is a dental procedure where a bone is artificially grafted (attached) to a bone in the jaw, which is either broken, damaged, or needs supplementary support.

Several other reasons for bone grafting include:
<ul>
 	<li>gum infections,</li>
 	<li>loss of one or more teeth in adults,</li>
 	<li>when a person intends to go for dental implant procedures.</li>
</ul>
The grafted bone can be taken from any part of the human body, preferably the hip bone or tibia bone, and then the dentist incises and fits the separated bone into the jawbone. Synthetic bones are also prepared for grafting purposes. Once the procedure is done, the grafted bone simply holds the missing gaps together and allows the body to heal and tissues to regenerate. The process for bone grafting is pretty simple; the doctor sedates the patient through anesthesia after which a cut is made into the gums and the tissues moved aside to make the jawbone visible. Then, after careful disinfection, the separated bone is attached to the slit. In some cases, the bone is covered with an additional membrane sheet to ensure protection. The gum tissues are then stitched with the bone in place. The overall operation is not much painful if the attached bone is artificially created. With being given anesthesia throughout the surgery, the patient does not feel much. However, if the bone is taken from the patient’s body, the procedure might become painful as the patient has to go through surgeries in two parts, the jaw, and the hip.

The side effects of this dental surgery might vary from person to person. Some people do not feel the after-effects at all while others suffer from acute to chronic symptoms depending upon the nature of bone grafting. However, the most generic outcomes are:
<ul>
 	<li>Discomfort</li>
 	<li>Swelling</li>
 	<li>Bruising</li>
 	<li>Pain in jawbone</li>
 	<li>Bone particles splintering</li>
</ul>
To deal with these symptoms, the dentist might prescribe antibiotics and painkillers. The recovery from these signs can be as less as a week or as long as a fortnight. Though the tissues and jawbone might take months before recovering. If the post-treatment ailment prolongs and the symptoms become worse over time, then that is probably the indication of a failed surgery. The probability ratio of failure is minimal, but since it is a medical treatment, the results can go both ways. Unbearable pain, continuous breaking up of attached bone, opening up of stitches, no healing, etc. are the indicators of the operation being flopped.

In a nutshell, bone grafting is a surgical treatment aimed at attaching a bone from elsewhere to the jawbone either to provide extra support to the weak jawbone or to eliminate the risks associated with an unhealthy jawbone. Like all other surgeries, bone grafting carries its ratio of risk and reward and strictly varies from person to person how the procedure turns out.

Bone development in the upper jaw, such as a sinus or a ridge augmentation, may be required during dental surgery (also known as oral-maxillofacial surgeries).

In the upper jaw, a bone graft may promote bone development that will allow for dental implants to be placed. For those who have lost teeth, these implants can be used to replace them.&nbsp;
<h5>- Who may need Bone Grafting?</h5>
Any person who has had a tooth extracted might require a bone graft before receiving a dental implant. Even if you come in the day after losing a tooth, you can still have a dental implant. However, there is a possibility that the socket is infected or that the missing tooth is too small to accept an immediate replacement.&nbsp;

Of course, no one gets an implant the day they lose their teeth. In certain cases, it's because of financial constraints. It can be a logistical issue at times. Bone loss happens every day that a tooth is missing, regardless of the cause.
<h5>- Why do you need bone grafting?</h5>
For various reasons, preserving and restoring facial bone integrity is necessary. To have the best outcomes from dental operations like dental implant insertion, the bone must be as similar to its natural size and location as feasible. The skin and muscles that give us our outer look are supported by the jaw and other facial bones. Our faces might seem older than they are if the underlying bone structure isn't there to sustain them.
<h5>- How does bone grafting help you?</h5>
A region of bone in the jaw known as the alveolar ridge anchors teeth in place. The alveolar ridge bone protects teeth by encircling their roots and allowing them to function normally, like chewing. The jaw cannot sustain natural teeth or dental implants if the alveolar ridge bone is inadequate.

Bone loss in the jaw can occur for a variety of causes. If you've had a tooth knocked out and the bone around it has been gone, or if you have gum disease, these are two possibilities. Your jaws may not have enough bone to sustain your natural teeth or the effective implantation of dental implants, whichever the reason may be.

Dental bone graft surgery may be recommended if you have lost alveolar ridge bone and need to generate new bone for dental implants.

The most common reasons for undergoing a dental bone grafting procedure are tooth loss, gum disease, or trauma. After tooth extraction, bone grafting may restore lost density to the jawbone.
<h5>- Is bone grafting a painful procedure?</h5>
Absolutely not! All of us here at the office do them every single day. Patients are often sedated for the process, which is an outpatient procedure. There should be no discomfort as the graft heals, and you'll be all set for your dental implants once the graft is complete. Fomostof people, a bone transplant is merely the initial step before they can fully enjoy their gorgeous new replacement teeth.
<h5>Sinus Lifting:</h5>
Having insufficient jaw bone to support dental implants may necessitate sinus lift surgery. Sinus augmentation and sinus transplants are other terms for this operation. Periodontists or oral surgeons undertake this operation.
A dental expert can do sinus lift surgery in a variety of methods. In some cases, getting a dental implant requires a sinus lift and bone grafting as a first step.

If you’re considering having your sinuses lifted, you have various options. Bone graft type and the doctor’s future dental implant placement plan play a role in which strategy is best for you and your situation.

The procedure proceeds in the following manner:&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>Before the operation, you and your doctor will discuss the best course of action for you.</li>
 	<li>
The dentist might give you oral or IV anesthetics to make you comfortable, and a dentist will numb the region with local anesthesia.</li>
 	<li>
To gain access to the jawbone, your surgeon will create incisions in the rear of your gum tissue.</li>
 	<li>
Your surgeon will make a tiny incision in the bone, taking care to avoid cutting into the sinus membranes.</li>
 	<li>
Your surgeon will raise the membrane in the sinus cavity by lifting the sliced bone piece.</li>
 	<li>
Bone graft materials will be injected into the freshly raised region by your surgeon. Synthetic bone material can be used as an alternative to using your bones for deducing graft material.</li>
 	<li>
Your surgeon will stitch up the incisions in your gums.</li>
 	<li>
After the operation, your doctor will provide you with recuperation instructions.</li>
</ul>
Research shows that having sinus lift surgery significantly increases the likelihood of having successful implants that will continue to function normally over several years. This surgery is relatively painless for the vast majority of individuals. Before the implant treatment, a specialist should thoroughly examine your jawbone health and discuss their sinus lift suggestions, procedures, and probable bone grafting materials.

Bone graft type and the doctor\u2019s future dental implant placement plan play a role in which strategy is best for you and your situation.<\/p>\n<p>The procedure proceeds in the following manner:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><ul><li>Before the operation, you and your doctor will discuss the best course of action for you.<\/li><li>\nThe dentist might give you oral or IV anesthetics to make you comfortable, and a dentist will numb the region with local anesthesia.<\/li><li>\nTo gain access to the jawbone, your surgeon will create incisions in the rear of your gum tissue.<\/li><li>\nYour surgeon will make a tiny incision in the bone, taking care to avoid cutting into the sinus membranes.<\/li><li>\nYour surgeon will raise the membrane in the sinus cavity by lifting the sliced bone piece.<\/li><li>\nBone graft materials will be injected into the freshly raised region by your surgeon. Synthetic bone material can be used as an alternative to using your bones for deducing graft material.<\/li><li>\nYour surgeon will stitch up the incisions in your gums.<\/li><li>\nAfter the operation, your doctor will provide you with recuperation instructions.<\/li><\/ul><\/p>\n<p>Research shows that having sinus lift surgery significantly increases the likelihood of having successful implants that will continue to function normally over several years. This surgery is relatively painless for the vast majority of individuals. Before the implant treatment, a specialist should thoroughly examine your jawbone health and discuss their sinus lift suggestions, procedures, and probable bone grafting materials.<\/p>","align":"left","text_color":"#FFFFFF","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Lato","typography_font_size":{"unit":"px","size":17,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_size_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":17,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_weight":"400","typography_line_height":{"unit":"px","size":24,"sizes":[]},"typography_line_height_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":"","sizes":[]}},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false},{"id":"25cd6542","elType":"section","settings":{"gap":"no","content_position":"middle","structure":"20","background_background":"classic","background_color":"#E7DABF","margin":{"unit":"px","top":"","right":0,"bottom":"","left":0,"isLinked":true},"padding":{"unit":"px","top":"60","right":"0","bottom":"60","left":"0","isLinked":false},"padding_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"40","right":"20","bottom":"40","left":"20","isLinked":false},"padding_mobile":{"unit":"px","top":"50","right":"20","bottom":"50","left":"20","isLinked":false},"padding_laptop":{"unit":"px","top":"80","right":"20","bottom":"80","left":"20","isLinked":false},"padding_tablet_extra":{"unit":"px","top":"40","right":"20","bottom":"40","left":"20","isLinked":false}},"elements":[{"id":"c78f4cf","elType":"column","settings":{"_column_size":50,"_inline_size":73.144,"_inline_size_tablet":70,"_inline_size_mobile_extra":65},"elements":[{"id":"afe8df1","elType":"widget","settings":{"title":"Make an appointment","title_color":"#08342E","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Lato","typography_font_size":{"unit":"px","size":30,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_weight":"900","typography_line_height":{"unit":"px","size":35,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_size_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":24,"sizes":[]},"typography_line_height_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":35,"sizes":[]}},"elements":[],"widgetType":"heading"},{"id":"b0e81ba","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"Complete the form and we will send you a confirmation within 24 hours.","text_color":"#08342E","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Lato","typography_font_size":{"unit":"px","size":17,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_size_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":17,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_weight":"400","typography_line_height":{"unit":"px","size":24,"sizes":[]},"typography_line_height_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":"","sizes":[]}},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false},{"id":"46581c02","elType":"column","settings":{"_column_size":50,"_inline_size":26.856,"_inline_size_tablet":30,"_inline_size_mobile_extra":35,"padding_mobile":{"unit":"px","top":"20","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":false}},"elements":[{"id":"b5f48ea","elType":"widget","settings":{"text":"Visit Appointment Form","align_mobile":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Lato","typography_font_size":{"unit":"px","size":17,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_weight":"900","typography_line_height":{"unit":"px","size":25,"sizes":[]},"button_text_color":"#08342E","background_color":"#61CE7000","border_border":"solid","border_width":{"unit":"px","top":"1","right":"1","bottom":"1","left":"1","isLinked":true},"border_color":"#08342E","border_radius":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"align":"right","link":{"url":"https:\/\/nobledentalcares.com\/contacts\/","is_external":"","nofollow":"","custom_attributes":""}},"elements":[],"widgetType":"button"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Nitrous Oxide Sedation</h2>
Laughing gas, or nitrous oxide, is widely used to help patients relax during dental treatments.
Because it is a gas, the effects fade fast after you stop inhaling them   Patients who are just given laughing gas as a sedative are frequently permitted to drive themselves home following surgery.
<h5>- How is Nitrous Oxide administered?</h5>
The dentist provides you with a nasal device so that you may inhale the laughing gas. The effects are minimal, and you'll notice the gas in your lungs after 30 seconds of first inhaling it, at the most. The nitrous oxide relaxes some individuals enough that they do not need additional sedation. However, a combination of laughing gas and oral sedation is necessary for certain individuals.&nbsp;

To avoid headaches, patients must be given oxygen for at least five minutes after the nitrous oxide has been switched off. Oxygen helps patients wake up and become more aware by removing excess gas from their lungs. A little lunch before the surgery can help patients avoid nausea and vomiting, as can delaying a heavy meal for up to three hours afterward. Ask your dentist if it is safe to drive after a dental operation.
<h5>- Benefits of Nitrous Oxide sedation</h5>
Dentists use nitrous oxide for a variety of reasons. To begin, the sedation's duration can be swiftly increased or decreased. It is also incredibly safe for the brain, heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys and acts very quickly (in around 2 or 3 minutes). Children, people with disabilities, and those who have dental anxiety can all benefit from the relaxing and numbing benefits of nitrous oxide inhalation, which is done without using needles.

No internal organs are harmed by inhaling nitrous oxide, which is quite safe. When administered by a doctor, the only major hazards of taking nitrous oxide are the dizzying effects, which might cause you to slip or fall if you stand up too quickly. It's fortunate that these symptoms only continue for a few minutes once the mask is removed. This therapy does not cause a "hangover," and you will be able to drive yourself home afterward.
<h5>- Is nitrous oxide safe for people of all ages?</h5>
According to the AAPD, laughing gas is widely accepted by youngsters and may be readily administered. A tingling or warming sensation can be felt by many children when they use the gas. Even if the surgery isn't painful, the child may need to be immobile for a lengthy amount of time. While some children may have nausea or trouble wearing the mask, others may not. As part of your child's dental care, you should inquire about sedation alternatives.

Dentists often use dental sedation to alleviate patients' anxieties and discomfort. Ask your dentist about oral sedation and plan your next procedure instead of putting it off because you're afraid to go to the dentist.&nbsp;

As part of your child's dental care, you should inquire about sedation alternatives. <\/p>\n<p>Dentists often use dental sedation to alleviate patients' anxieties and discomfort.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>General Dentistry</h2>		
		The health of your mouth, teeth, and gums depends on regular visits to your general dentist. Why do individuals put off dental visits? When visiting the dentist, it's not unusual to feel worried or anxious.		
		In addition, many people are concerned about the cost of medical care and examinations as preventative measures. However, you aren't the only one who doesn't go to the dentist because of a lack of awareness of how essential checkups are, what they cover, and what a general dentist can offer. We'll explain General Dentistry and why regular dental exams are vital.		
			<h2>Definition:</h2>		
		<p>General dentistry comprises all oral and maxillofacial pathology aspects and their influence on human health. A general dentist provides these services according to their training and expertise and according to the profession's ethics and relevant legal standards. </p><p>General dentistry focuses on preventing illness rather than treating those who already have it. According to estimates, nearly two-thirds of all dental operations are diagnostic or preventative. General Dentists assist patients avoid worsening oral disorders by emphasizing the need for good oral hygiene. Because in the long run, unaddressed discomfort might develop from these conditions.</p>		
			<h2>Scope of Work:</h2>		
		<p>Currently, dentists who practice general dentistry account for the vast majority (80%) of all dental practitioners. Unlike specialists, regular dentists offer a variety of procedures like preventive and restorative services, x-rays, dental cleanings, cavity fillings, and sealants. People of all ages receive most of their dental treatment from general practitioners.</p><ul><li>Routine dental appointments include a complete inspection of your mouth (including teeth, gums, and other tissues).</li><li>A professional cleaning.</li><li>An in-depth discussion of your dental (and general) well-being.</li><li>If you have tooth decay, you'll need a filling.</li></ul><p>Even though these procedures are widespread, your general dentist offers much more than just this.</p>		
			<h2>Types of Services:</h2>		
		General dentists provide a wide range of services, categorized as restorative, preventative, and cosmetic dentistry.		
			<h2>Preventive treatments:</h2>		
		<p>These prevent oral illness from spreading. Regular dental examinations, skilled tooth cleanings, and diagnostic images like x-rays are essential in preventive treatment to keep gum disease at </p><p>bay. Your dentist may offer you guidelines to enhance your at-home dental hygiene. In addition, if you are physically active, your dentist can provide you with a custom-made mouthguard. Preventive therapy can only be successful if the patient and general dentist collaborate properly.</p><p><b><u>Routine examinations:</u></b> </p><p>Developing a personalized dental treatment plan begins with a regular checkup. It helps your dentist determine what treatment you need for dental health. Dental examinations, sometimes known as "dental checkups," give a comprehensive review of head and neck tissues, jaw joints, mouth, teeth, and gums—detecting underlying oral health issues such as infection, tooth decay, and oral malignancy.</p><p>Preventing problems from getting worse is the goal of a routine physical exam. These regular checkups are critical since many oral health disorders are "silent" and go unreported. It is essential to realize that a normal dental exam will not avoid oral health concerns. It looks at your specific circumstances and develops a strategy to help you prevent complications and enhance your dental health in general.</p><p><b><u>X-Rays:</u></b></p><p>A dental X-ray exhibits a lot of information about your teeth and gums that an oral examination alone cannot provide. Dentists rely on X-rays to detect oral abnormalities that aren't always apparent to the patient's naked eye or tactile feel.</p><ul><li>Without an x-ray, it's impossible to tell if you have decay between your teeth.</li><li>An x-ray can show small abscesses or tumors that are difficult to detect during an oral examination.</li><li>An x-ray may be necessary for dental treatment like dental implants to acquire a clearer picture of the teeth's location.</li></ul>		
			<h2>Restorative Services:</h2>		
		Your dentist will ensure that you receive quick and proper treatment if there is an issue. Restoring a tooth's function and appearance by filling a cavity is one of the most common (and cost-effective) dental restorations. Restorative dentistry provided by general dentists does not stop there. It includes dental trauma which needs immediate attention, such as a shattered, loosed, or knocked-out tooth. General dentists can treat tooth discomfort or gum disease. They may also assist you in acquiring dentures, putting crowns or bridges, and help you seek care for missing teeth. Root canal therapy and dental implants are just a few of the more specialized services some general practices offer.		
			<h2>Cosmetic dentistry:</h2>		
		<p>Among dentistry's most rapidly expanding specialties is cosmetic dentistry. This is an option for many individuals who want to look their best. These procedures improve a person's smile, promoting their confidence and enhancing their attractiveness. A certified dental practitioner can safely perform aesthetic procedures on patients of any age. Options for treatment include veneers and in-office professional whitening.</p>		
			<h2>Takeaway:</h2>		
		<p>The frequency and severity of dental problems increase with age. Taking good care of your natural teeth, such as frequent dentist appointments, a balanced diet, and appropriate care at home, is best to preserve them. Please make an appointment with your family dentist to learn more about the services you need and to have your smile restored before it is too late! </p>		
			<h2>Dental Exam:</h2>		
		A comprehensive dental exam will be performed by your dentist at your initial dental visit. At regular check-up exams, your dentist and hygienist will include the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Examination of diagnostic x-rays (radiographs): Essential for detection of decay, tumors, cysts, and bone loss. X-rays also help determine tooth and root positions.</li>
 	<li>Oral cancer screening: Check the face, neck, lips, tongue, throat, tissues, and gums for any signs of oral cancer.</li>
 	<li>Gum disease evaluation: Check the gums and bone around the teeth for any signs of periodontal disease.</li>
 	<li>Examination of tooth decay: All tooth surfaces will be checked for decay with special dental instruments.</li>
 	<li>Examination of existing restorations: Check current fillings, crowns, etc.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Professional Teeth Cleaning</h2>
To avoid tooth decay and gum diseases, to get a dental exam and cleaning every six months are advised.&nbsp;

Dental examinations and professional teeth cleanings will help your dentist evaluate the health of your teeth and gums. This also eliminates many germs from the mouth since bacteria reside in plaque and tartar.&nbsp;
Dentist appointments are dreaded by many. It's easy to see why they're worried, the poking, the unusual noises, and the occasional jaw soreness. However, most people don't feel any discomfort regarding tooth cleanings. When you're well-informed about the procedure, it's easier to relax and take pleasure in the fresh, minty effects of Professional Dental Cleaning.
<h2>Dental Examination:</h2>
A dental hygienist performs the vast majority of cleanings. Before cleaning, they do a full mouth evaluation. Gingivitis (inflamed gums) and other dental issues can be spotted by a dental hygienist using a tiny mirror. The dental hygienist may call the dentist if they identify serious concerns and need to know if it's safe to proceed.
<h2>Plaque and Tartar Removal:</h2>
With a tiny mirror to help them, the dental hygienist uses a scaler to remove plaque and tartar from your gum line and teeth. Despite the sound of scratching, it's natural. The greater the tartar in your mouth, the longer it will take to scrape a particular area.
Brushing and Flossing regularly prevent plaque from accumulating and hardening into tartar by brushing and flossing regularly. The takeaway for those who dread it is to brush and floss more frequently.&nbsp;
<h2>High-powered electric brush cleaning:</h2>
After removing all tartar, the hygienist washes your teeth with a high-powered electric brush. It sounds terrible, but it's a terrific technique to eliminate tartar which is left behind after using a scaler. Its rough texture cleanses teeth. If done by a professional, twice-yearly tooth polishing is safe. Although the enamel on your teeth will thin out if you're harsh with them at home, so be gentle.
<h2>Professional Flossing:</h2>
Whether or not you floss regularly, a skilled flossing session is the best. If you have gum bleeding, your dental hygienist can find the source of the problem by probing deep between your teeth. Through Professional Flossing, your teeth eliminate leftover plaque or toothpaste from the cleaning process.
<h2>Rinsing &amp; fluoride treatment:</h2>
To proceed further, the dentist will ask you to rinse your mouth to remove particles, preferably with a fluoride liquid. Finally, a fluoride treatment completes the cleaning procedure, protecting teeth against cavities for months.
The frothy gel (or sticky paste) is applied in a mouthpiece that fits over your teeth. For the most part, it's just left on your teeth for one minute. Besides the foamy gel, with the help of a little brush, fluoride varnish is applied to the teeth. Fluoride varnish hardens by coming in contact with saliva, so you may eat and drink immediately.&nbsp;
<h2>Types of Professional Dental Cleaning:</h2>
Depending on the quantity of tartar and plaque on your teeth, your dentist will conduct one of the four following dental cleanings:
<ol>
 	<li><b>Prophylaxis Dental Cleaning</b> is performed to keep healthy teeth free of decay and illness by removing plaque and tartar from their surfaces.</li>
 	<li><b>Scaling and Root Planning Cleaning</b>, also known as Deep cleaning, are performed on both the teeth and the gum pockets to cure gum disease or periodontitis and require multiple appointments.</li>
 	<li><b>Periodontal Maintenance Cleaning</b> is used in the treatment of gingivitis. The procedure removes plaque and tartar from the tooth surface, and gum pockets, then smooth the roots if needed. This type of cleaning is the most common practice because Gum disease progresses and worsens if not addressed.</li>
 	<li><b>Gross Debridement Cleaning</b> removes excessive plaque and tartar from teeth. Those patients who struggle to maintain an oral care regimen or have avoided the dentist for a long time should go for this cleaning.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Composite Filling</h2>		
		A composite (tooth colored) filling is used to repair a tooth that is affected by decay, cracks, fractures, etc.		
		<p id="viewer-v0j09547541">The decayed or affected portion of the tooth will be removed and then filled with a composite filling.</p>
<p id="viewer-bd1kf547542"> </p>
<p id="viewer-n6w90547543">There are many types of filling materials available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. You and your dentist can discuss the best options for restoring your teeth. Composite fillings, along with silver amalgam fillings, are the most widely used today. Because composite fillings are tooth colored, they can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth, and are more aesthetically suited for use in front teeth or the more visible areas of the teeth.</p>
<p id="viewer-17mrr547544"> </p>
<p id="viewer-zm9mz547545">As with most dental restorations, composite fillings are not permanent and may someday have to be replaced. They are very durable, and will last many years, giving you a long lasting, beautiful smile.</p>
<p id="viewer-gjits547546"> </p>
<p id="viewer-e63xt547547">Reasons for composite fillings:</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Teeth Whitening</h2>
Tooth whitening (or bleaching) is a simple, non-invasive dental treatment used to change the color of natural tooth enamel and is an ideal way to enhance the beauty of your smile

Because having whiter teeth has now become the number one aesthetic concern of most patients, there are a number of ways to whiten teeth. The most popular method is using a home tooth whitening system that will whiten teeth dramatically. Since tooth whitening only works on natural tooth enamel, it is important to evaluate replacement of any old fillings, crowns, etc. Replacement of any restorations will be done after bleaching so they will match the newly bleached teeth.

Tooth whitening is not permanent. A touch-up maybe needed every several years, and more often if you smoke, drink coffee, tea, or wine.
Reasons for tooth whitening:
<ul>
 	<li>Fluorosis (excessive fluoridation during tooth development).</li>
 	<li>Normal wear of outer tooth layer.</li>
 	<li>Stained teeth due to medications (tetracycline, etc.).</li>
 	<li>Yellow, brown stained teeth.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Full &amp; Partial Dentures</h2>
Whether from trauma or illness, missing teeth make it difficult for people to bite, eat, and talk properly.

Even the structure and form of a person's face can be affected by tooth loss because teeth prevent facial muscles from drooping. Dentures are removable fake teeth composed of acrylic (plastic), nylon, or metal. Dentures have tightly fitted designs over the gums to replace lost teeth and avoid any difficulties caused by gaps.&nbsp;

A person with a substantial number of lost teeth may choose between full and partial dentures. However, there are more considerations; let's analyze a few of them:
<h2>Full denture:</h2>
Tooth decay and gum disease can become uncontrolled in some cases. This may lead to removing the remaining teeth from one or both arches. Full dentures are a cost-effective solution if you've lost all of your teeth.&nbsp;

<b>Structure:</b> A gum-colored acrylic base is a foundation for a complete denture. Replacement teeth made of porcelain or acrylic are inserted into the base to resemble natural teeth. Your dentist will guide you in picking the teeth that seem the most natural. This lets you personalize your appearance, whether you want a "fresh" grin or to restore your old one.

<b>Implant-supported dentures:</b> Dentures have a long history of success, but new technology allows you to customize the fit and appearance of your dentures. Implant-supported dentures last longer, have better retention, and seem more natural. Surgically inserted Dental implants can help connect dentures to the mouth more securely
<h2>The Benefits:</h2>
People who have no or few recoverable teeth might consider getting complete dentures.
<ul>
 	<li>When getting dentures, extra care is given to treating dental issues such as decaying teeth, infection control, and pain relief to ensure a healthy mouth.</li>
 	<li>Full dentures are a terrific approach to improve oral health for people with severe or persistent tooth issues, but you may need to let your mouth recover first.</li>
 	<li>Full dentures can help fill up a sunken, toothless face. You'll look and feel younger.</li>
 	<li>The ability to eat a wide variety of meals will also be restored with complete dentures, enhancing your general health.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Partial Dentures:</h2>
One or more artificial teeth become part of a plate to form a partial denture. If the patient retains several healthy, sturdy teeth, they can serve as the foundation for partial dentures. Due to their careful design, they fit correctly in the mouth's top and/or bottom to replace missing teeth. They should be removed before bedtime and soaked overnight in a denture cleaning fluid.

Structure: Most partial dentures include a thin metal framework with small metal clasps designed to wrap around the gum line. This makes it smooth and non-bulky. Natural teeth support the framework,

making it a dependable and secure appliance that is very simple to put and take off. Gum-colored acrylic covers the metal construction, and natural-looking teeth replace missing teeth.&nbsp;
<h2>The Benefits:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Partial dentures are less expensive and can be used to replace a single or a few missing teeth.</li>
 	<li>They can instantly improve your smile's appearance.</li>
 	<li>Same-day dentures may be an option for you, so you don't have to wait long to obtain your new dentures.</li>
 	<li>Your remaining teeth may benefit from partial dentures as well. The remaining teeth will not move or weaken due to partial dentures.</li>
 	<li>Partial dentures help you avoid excessive usage of one side of the mouth, which leads to wear and damage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>After Care:</h2>
For a few weeks, new dentures may feel strange. While your cheek and tongue muscles adjust, the dentures may feel loose. Saliva flow may rise briefly. These issues should disappear as your mouth adjusts to the dentures. Consult your dentist if discomfort or pain continues.&nbsp;

Daily brushing removes food particles and plaque from dentures, much like teeth. It will help if you practice proper oral care, even with complete dentures. Before inserting your dentures, clean your mouth's gums, tongue, and roof with a soft-bristled brush to increase circulation and eliminate plaque.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Wisdom Tooth Extractions</h2>
Wisdom tooth extraction is a surgical operation to remove one or more wisdom teeth — the four lifelong adult teeth located in the rear corners of your mouth on the top and bottom.

The dentist advises removing wisdom teeth in most cases because they cannot develop properly and cause discomfort, infection, or other dental issues. Oral surgeons and dentists are both capable of removing third molars.

Even if impacted teeth aren't creating difficulties, some dentists and oral surgeons advocate wisdom tooth removal to avoid future issues.
<h2>Problem?</h2>
The most common cause for removing them is:
• Due to their location, wisdom teeth may not erupt regularly. Your jawbone or gums might get infected if they become lodged there.
<ul>
 	<li>They're crooked and may irritate the gums around your teeth.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li>Your mouth is too small. There is no place in your jaw for an additional pair of molars.</li>
 	<li>In some cases, you may develop gum disease or cavities. You may not be able to brush or floss around your wisdom teeth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pre-Extraction:</h2>
The operation can be done in your dentist's office. When an oral surgeon is needed, your dentist may refer you to one of the teeth that is severely damaged or if the extraction requires a significant amount of surgical intervention. To make the patient comfortable, the following options are available:
<ul>
 	<li>A local anesthetic injection before extraction.</li>
 	<li>Your dentist or surgeon may give you a sedative if you're nervous—usually, an arm injection.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li>Wisdom tooth removal seldom requires general anesthesia. Rarely used in-hospital procedures. However, you should be able to leave home the same day.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extraction Procedure:</h2>
An incision in the gum is necessary if the tooth hasn't broken through the gum yet. The surgeon will cut the tooth into smaller pieces to facilitate extraction through the incision. When a tooth breaks through the gum, a smaller incision is needed.

Before removing the tooth, your dentist or oral surgeon will need to rock the tooth back and forth to expand the socket in your mouth.
The region around your wisdom teeth will be numbed, so you shouldn't experience any discomfort during removal. If you experience any pain, alert your dentist or oral surgeon so that they can provide more anesthetic if necessary.

To be sure, the time it takes to pull out the tooth will be different for everyone. Simple operations require a few minutes, but more complex procedures might take longer than 20 minutes.
<h2>After Extraction:</h2>
If you're awake and have a local anesthetic, you may be able to drive home. General anesthesia or sleepiness requires a ride home.
Most post-op patients report minimal pain. You'll experience discomfort and inflammation for 3-4 days, but full recovery may take a few weeks.
Make sure you follow your doctor's orders exactly to speed up your healing. Here are a few pointers for the first three days following surgery:
<h2>yes:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Use an ice pack to reduce swelling and skin discoloration.</li>
 	<li>Sore jaw? Apply moist heat.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li>Exercise your jaw by opening and closing your mouth.</li>
 	<li>Consume a diet of softer foods like pasta, rice, or soup.</li>
 	<li>Hydrate.</li>
 	<li>Start brushing your teeth on day 2. Don't touch any blood clots that may be present.</li>
 	<li>&nbsp;Take painkillers as prescribed.</li>
 	<li>See a doctor if you have a fever, discomfort, or swelling.</li>
</ul>
<h2>yes:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Avoid straws. Sucking might dislodge blood clots that heal the mouth.</li>
 	<li>Don't over-rinse. Your doctor may prescribe a little saltwater rinse.</li>
 	<li>Avoid hard, crunchy, or sticky foods that might irritate wounds.</li>
 	<li>No smoking. Smoking slows recovery.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results:</h2>
After your wisdom teeth extraction, it may take a week or so to settle back into a routine, but you'll soon be able to smile without discomfort! You won't need to visit your doctor right after extraction if there are no chronic infection symptoms, nerve injury, or other disorders such as swelling, numbness, or bleeding.

Make sure to keep up with your regular dental appointments so your dentist can monitor the progress of your wisdom teeth. Extraction of the back molars may sound frightening, but it is a simple surgery that may give your smile a good start in the years to come.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Endodontics</h2>		
		Root canal therapy is needed when the nerve of a tooth is affected by decay or infection		
		<p id="viewer-wj6xr547827">In order to save the tooth, the pulp (the living tissue inside the tooth), nerves, bacteria, and any decay are removed and the resulting space is filled with special, medicated, dental materials, which restore the tooth to its full function.</p>
<p id="viewer-t30u4547828"> </p>
<p id="viewer-ha7xk547829">Having a root canal done on a tooth is the treatment of choice to save a tooth that otherwise would die and have to be removed. Many patients believe that removing a tooth that has problems is the solution, but what is not realized is that extracting (pulling) a tooth will ultimately be more costly and cause significant problems for adjacent teeth.</p>
<p id="viewer-bsv5m547830"> </p>
<p id="viewer-ma83k547831">Root canal treatment is highly successful and usually lasts a lifetime, although on occasion, a tooth will have to be retreated due to new infections.</p>
<p id="viewer-hv2bb547832"> </p>
<p id="viewer-fypoz547833">Signs and symptoms for possible root canal therapy:</p>
<ul>
<li id="viewer-z289p547835">
<p>An abscess (or pimple) on the gums.</p>
</li>
<li id="viewer-ye6wy547837">
<p>Sensitivity to hot and cold.</p>
</li>
<li id="viewer-rk3yy547839">
<p>Severe toothache pain.</p>
</li>
<li id="viewer-j1h7q547841">
<p>Sometimes no symptoms are present.</p>
</li>
<li id="viewer-8v2jw547843">
<p>Swelling and/or tenderness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="viewer-y3vq2547845"> </p>
<p id="viewer-gsi6p547846">Reasons for root canal therapy:</p>
<ul>
<li id="viewer-wobzm547848">
<p>Decay has reached the tooth pulp (the living tissue inside the tooth).</p>
</li>
<li id="viewer-832ip547850">
<p>Infection or abscess have developed inside the tooth or at the root tip.</p>
</li>
<li id="viewer-r25z0547852">
<p>Injury or trauma to the tooth.</p>
</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Sleep Apnea</h2>
Sleep apnea occurs when breathing stops during sleep. Those with untreated sleep apnea frequently stop breathing during the night, which can happen hundreds of times.
If untreated, sleep apnea can cause hypertension, stroke, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and diabetes. It can cause work impairment, work-related accidents, car collisions, and educational underachievement in children and teens.
<h5>Types</h5>
<h5>1.	Obstructive sleep apnea:</h5>
Obstructive sleep apnea causes repeated upper airway blockages during sleep due to the relaxation of the muscles in the back of the throat. Respiratory distress causes the diaphragm and chest muscles to work harder to open the airway. Relaxed muscles constrict your airway when you breathe in. Insufficient air lowers blood oxygen levels. Your brain wakes you up when you can't breathe so that you can reopen your airway. This short waking is often forgotten but is in the form of a snort, choke, or gulp. This cycle can recur five to 30 times each hour during the night, preventing you from slumbering in the deepest, most restorative slumber.
<h5>Risks:</h5>
Sleep apnea may impact people of any age, including children. However, several variables raise your risk of getting Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
<ul>
 	<li>Obesity: Your upper airway might get obstructed if you have a lot of fat around it.</li>
 	<li>People with thicker necks.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li>A narrow throat, growth in children's tonsils, and adenoids.</li>
 	<li>Men get sleep apnea twice as often as women. Women's risk increases with obesity and menopause.</li>
 	<li>Old age.</li>
 	<li>Alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers.</li>
 	<li>Smokers are at risk three times more.</li>
 	<li>If you have trouble breathing through your nose.</li>
 	<li>Congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and Parkinson's disease.</li>
 	<li>Polycystic ovarian syndrome, hormonal abnormalities, a past stroke, and asthma.</li>
</ul>
<h5>2.	Central sleep apnea:</h5>
This uncommon sleep apnea happens when the brain cannot send instructions to the breathing muscles. It means you stop breathing briefly. Shortness of breath may wake you up, and it troubles you in falling or staying asleep. This type is directly connected to how your brain and the neurological system work. It is more common in persons with neuromuscular diseases like ALS, stroke, heart, kidney, or lung problems.
<h5>Risks:</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Middle-aged and older persons.</li>
 	<li>Men are more likely to suffer from central sleep apnea than women.</li>
 	<li>Congestive heart failure.</li>
 	<li>Stroke.</li>
 	<li>Long-acting narcotics like methadone.</li>
</ul>
<h5>3.	Complex sleep apnea:</h5>
When you have obstructive and central sleep apnea, clinicians call it Complex sleep apnea. Your doctor may conduct an examination based on your signs and symptoms and a sleep history, which you may offer, with the assistance of someone who sleeps in your bed or your home, if you can provide such information.
<h5>Sleep Apnea Diagnosis:</h5>
Diagnosis for sleep apnea is concluded through various tests, which include:
<ul>
 	<li><b>Nocturnal Polysomnography: </b>You'll likely be directed to a sleep facility where a sleep specialist can evaluate your nightly breathing and bodily function. During this test, machines monitor your heart, lungs, brain, respiration, arm and leg movements, and blood oxygen levels while you sleep.</li>
 	<li><b>Self-sleep testing:</b> Your doctor might provide you with simplified tests to be used at home to diagnose sleep apnea. These tests evaluate heart rate, blood oxygen, airflow, and breathing.</li>
</ul>
If you have OSA, your doctor may recommend you to an ENT specialist to rule out a blockage or nasal congestion. Central sleep apnea may require a cardiologist or neurologist assessment to verify the underlying cause.
<h5>Mechanical Treatment:</h5>
Your doctor may prescribe weight loss, stopping smoking, or treating nasal allergies for mild sleep apnea. If they don't alleviate your symptoms, other therapies are available, which means your apnea is mild to severe. Some gadgets can unblock an airway, and sometimes surgery may be required.
<ul>
 	<li><b>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP):</b> This equipment provides air pressure through a mask during sleep. Snoring and breathing problems can be eased by breathing air that is at a pressure higher than the ambient air pressure. Some people find CPAP difficult or uncomfortable, despite being the most popular and effective treatment for sleep apnea. You may need to try many masks before finding one you like. If you have issues, keep using CPAP and consult your doctor about comfort adjustments.</li>
</ul>
See a doctor if you're still snoring after treatment or your weight changes. CPAP settings may need to be modified for accurate results.
<ul>
 	<li><b>Oral appliances</b> can keep your throat open. They are easier to use than CPAP. Your dentist can recommend one.</li>
 	<li><b>Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV)</b> "learns" your breath rhythm. This airflow gadget utilizes pressure to regulate your breathing as you sleep and eliminate any pauses. ASV is more successful than conventional PAP treatments for complex sleep apnea. However, people who suffer from central sleep apnea or severe heart failure may not be appropriate candidates for this device.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Surgical Treatments:</h5>
OSA patients and those who snore may benefit from surgical procedures. People with excessive or deformed tissue blocking their airways get the suggestion for surgery. Deviated nasal septums, enlarged tonsils, and a small lower jaw with an overbite contribute to narrowing the throat. Doctors perform these operations only after conservative treatments and CPAP have failed.
<ul>
 	<li><b>Somnoplasty </b>reduces upper airway soft tissue using radiofrequency radiation.</li>
 	<li><b>Tonsillectomy </b>removes tonsillar tissue, a significant source of blockage in children with sleep apnea.</li>
 	<li><b>Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) </b>removes soft tissue from the back of the neck and palate to widen the throat opening.</li>
 	<li><b>Mandibular/maxillary advancement surgery </b>corrects face or throat defects that cause OSA. This invasive surgery is for individuals with severe OSA and head-face deformities.</li>
 	<li><b>Nasal surgery </b>involves deviated septum repair.</li>
</ul>
Such a sleeping disorder condition in which a person faces difficulty in breathing during sleep is called sleep apnea. Such a sleeping disorder in which a person becomes unable to breath oftentimes. This makes it complicated for the body to get adequate oxygen.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea is most widely known form of this sleeping disorder. It happens when upper respiratory tract gets clogged frequently during sleep, causing airflow to be decreased or completely stopped. Adiposity, huge tonsils, or changes in hormone levels can all constrict the airway and raise the risk of obstructive sleeping disorder.

Central sleep apnea is another type which appears when the brain ceases to function the transmission of the necessary signals to enable the brain to breathe. Central sleep apnea occurs due to health issues that fluctuate how the brain operates the airway and chest muscles.
Symptoms of sleep apnea include
<ul>
 	<li>Sleep disruption</li>
 	<li>Loud snoring</li>
 	<li>Mild to severe difficulty in breathing while sleeping</li>
 	<li>Dry mouth</li>
 	<li>Headaches</li>
 	<li>Gasping for air while sleeping</li>
 	<li>Asthma</li>
</ul>
Some factors that cause sleep apnea are:
<ul>
 	<li>Age: risk of sleep apnea increases as you get older. With the increasing age, fatty tissues build up in the neck and increase the risk of sleep apnea.</li>
 	<li>Changes in hormones: people who have low levels of thyroid hormones are at high risk of getting sleep apnea</li>
 	<li>Heart and kidney problems: issues related to the heart and kidney cause fluids to build up in the neck, which blocks the upper airway and causes sleep apnea.</li>
 	<li>Large tonsils and a thick neck are also the factors that cause sleep apnea.</li>
 	<li>Other health problems like cleft lip, cleft palate, and down syndrome raise the risk of sleep apnea.</li>
</ul>
There are some sleep apnea appliances available that are the solution to sleep apnea, and help to improve the sleep quality. CPAP (Continuous Positive Air Pressure) and dental appliances are two of the most effective treatments that can help treat sleep apnea.
CPAP is a treatment that is conducted through a CPAP machine. These machines are consisting of:
A surgical mask.
Motor, that blows air down the throat with continuous pressure.
Tube which connects the mask and motor.

It is one of the most effectual procedure to treat sleep apnea, it improves sleep quality by keeping the airways open and eases snoring. These machines provide immediate relief from this sleeping disorder.
Mandibular advancement and tongue retaining gadgets are custom-made oral devices that also help to treat sleep apnea. Mandibular advancement gadgets look very similar to mouth guards that are used by athletes in sports. These devices push the tongue and jaw forward, which increases the airway space and prevent snoring and reduce sleep apnea. Tongue retaining devices are very less commonly used. This device holds the tongue in place and keeps the airway open and helps with the mild symptoms of sleep apnea. It also reduces the snoring and loudness of snoring.

These machines provide immediate relief from this sleeping disorder.<br>\nMandibular advancement and tongue retaining gadgets are custom-made oral devices that also help to treat sleep apnea. Mandibular advancement gadgets look very similar to mouth guards that are used by athletes in sports. These devices push the tongue and jaw forward, which increases the airway space and prevent snoring and reduce sleep apnea. Tongue retaining devices are very less commonly used. This device holds the tongue in place and keeps the airway open and helps with the mild symptoms of sleep apnea. It also reduces the snoring and loudness of snoring.<\/p>","align":"left","text_color":"#FFFFFF","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Lato","typography_font_size":{"unit":"px","size":17,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_size_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":17,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_weight":"400","typography_line_height":{"unit":"px","size":24,"sizes":[]},"typography_line_height_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":"","sizes":[]}},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false},{"id":"25cd6542","elType":"section","settings":{"gap":"no","content_position":"middle","structure":"20","background_background":"classic","background_color":"#E7DABF","margin":{"unit":"px","top":"","right":0,"bottom":"","left":0,"isLinked":true},"padding":{"unit":"px","top":"60","right":"0","bottom":"60","left":"0","isLinked":false},"padding_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"40","right":"20","bottom":"40","left":"20","isLinked":false},"padding_mobile":{"unit":"px","top":"50","right":"20","bottom":"50","left":"20","isLinked":false},"padding_laptop":{"unit":"px","top":"80","right":"20","bottom":"80","left":"20","isLinked":false},"padding_tablet_extra":{"unit":"px","top":"40","right":"20","bottom":"40","left":"20","isLinked":false}},"elements":[{"id":"c78f4cf","elType":"column","settings":{"_column_size":50,"_inline_size":73.144,"_inline_size_tablet":70,"_inline_size_mobile_extra":65},"elements":[{"id":"afe8df1","elType":"widget","settings":{"title":"Make an appointment","title_color":"#08342E","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Lato","typography_font_size":{"unit":"px","size":30,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_weight":"900","typography_line_height":{"unit":"px","size":35,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_size_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":24,"sizes":[]},"typography_line_height_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":35,"sizes":[]}},"elements":[],"widgetType":"heading"},{"id":"b0e81ba","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"Complete the form and we will send you a confirmation within 24 hours.","text_color":"#08342E","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Lato","typography_font_size":{"unit":"px","size":17,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_size_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":17,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_weight":"400","typography_line_height":{"unit":"px","size":24,"sizes":[]},"typography_line_height_mobile":{"unit":"px","size":"","sizes":[]}},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":false},{"id":"46581c02","elType":"column","settings":{"_column_size":50,"_inline_size":26.856,"_inline_size_tablet":30,"_inline_size_mobile_extra":35,"padding_mobile":{"unit":"px","top":"20","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":false}},"elements":[{"id":"b5f48ea","elType":"widget","settings":{"text":"Visit Appointment Form","align_mobile":"justify","typography_typography":"custom","typography_font_family":"Lato","typography_font_size":{"unit":"px","size":17,"sizes":[]},"typography_font_weight":"900","typography_line_height":{"unit":"px","size":25,"sizes":[]},"button_text_color":"#08342E","background_color":"#61CE7000","border_border":"solid","border_width":{"unit":"px","top":"1","right":"1","bottom":"1","left":"1","isLinked":true},"border_color":"#08342E","border_radius":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"align":"right","link":{"url":"https:\/\/nobledentalcares.com\/contacts\/","is_external":"","nofollow":"","custom_attributes":""}},"elements":[],"widgetType":"button"}],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]]]></wp:meta_value>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Cosmetic Dentistry </h2>		
		Veneers are very thin pieces of durable, tooth shaped porcelain that are custom made (for shape and color) by a professional dental laboratory		
			<h2>Cosmetic Dentistry:
</h2>		
Cosmetic dentistry focuses on improving the teeth and mouth's look. Although it covers more elective treatments, some cosmetic dentistry procedures are restorative as well. If you're unhappy with the appearance of your teeth owing to discoloration, wear, misalignment, or gaps, you can have a "smile makeover." You and your cosmetic dentist will plan treatment after a thorough examination of your oral health. The following information will help you learn more about the wide variety of cosmetic dental procedures.
			<h2>Cosmetic Procedures:
</h2>		
		Even the tiniest step can be beneficial to raise your self-confidence, self-esteem, and desire to smile. Cosmetic dentistry has come a long way in recent years, with operations ranging from a simple color correction to replacing missing teeth.
			<h2>Dental Veneers: 
</h2>		
		If you have gaps between your teeth or whitening hasn't worked, your dentist may recommend veneers. Porcelain or composite veneers cover the front surfaces of teeth to hide faults, including worn enamel, irregular spacing or alignment, discoloration, and enamel chips or fractures.
Veneers are part of cosmetic dentistry, but they may help preserve teeth and save more invasive operations. Veneers don't always require tooth pretreatment.
Dental veneers can cure several aesthetic dental concerns, including:
Enamel wear
Disuse
Genetics
Teeth misalignment
Discoloration
			<h2>Dental Bonding:
</h2>		
		Dentists may permanently attach dental materials to your teeth using dental adhesives and a high-intensity curing laser. Cosmetic bonding involves applying and hardening a tooth-colored resin to a patient's teeth with a specific light to enhance their smile. Cosmetic dental bonding is a low-risk, low-cost way to fix minor flaws in teeth, correct gaps between teeth, and even modify the appearance of teeth in place of more permanent silver amalgam fillings.
High-intensity laser hardens dental composite material that resembles enamel and dentin in color and structure. After that, proper shape and details are achievable through molding. Consequently, you'll have a bright, healthy smile that merges seamlessly with the rest of your natural teeth and the surrounding dental structure.
			<h2>Enamel Shaping:
</h2>		
		Enamel shaping is a short, painless process that improves the appearance of natural teeth. Minor flaws such as unequal teeth or teeth that are slightly overcrowded can be corrected using this technique. Results are instantly apparent, and it is common to combine whitening, veneers, or bonding with enamel shaping.
			<h2>Teeth Whitening:
</h2>		
		The most often prescribed cosmetic dental procedure is teeth whitening. Having your teeth whitened can improve the look of your smile. Smoking, eating, drinking (coffee, tea, or red wine), and poor dental hygiene are common causes of discolored teeth. 
			<h2>Smile Makeover:
</h2>		
		Smile makeovers analyze your smile's aesthetics to enhance its look. It is common for many teeth in both the upper and lower arches to undergo one or more cosmetic operations such as dental veneers, dental implants, gingival sculpting, and teeth whitening, and it benefits the patient on multiple issues. 
			<h2>Composite Fillings</h2>		
		When a filling wears down, chips, or cracks, it may be time to get a new one. Numerous people take advantage of this chance to replace their silver amalgam fillings with tooth-colored composites. In more extensive cavities, composite fillings wear out more quickly than silver fillings, yet they keep up just as well in smaller cavities.
			<h2>Composite Fillings</h2>		
		When a filling wears down, chips, or cracks, it may be time to get a new one. Numerous people take advantage of this chance to replace their silver amalgam fillings with tooth-colored composites. In more extensive cavities, composite fillings wear out more quickly than silver fillings, yet they keep up just as well in smaller cavities.
			<h2>Gum Reshaping:
</h2>		
		In cases where teeth seem excessively short or if the gum line is uneven, a "gummy" smile improves the gum contouring. A tiny bit of gum tissue and, if necessary, extra bone tissue is removed and shaped to reveal more of the teeth. 
			<h2>Finding the Right Cosmetic Dentist</h2>		
		Finding a cosmetic dentist with the proper training and experience necessitates some research. The number of dentists specializing in aesthetic dentistry is expanding, even though there is no recognized specialty. With so many treatments to select from and the possibility of interdisciplinary care, the options might be overwhelming.
The following approach can help you narrow down the right Cosmetic Dentist:
What's the dentist's experience?
Are you satisfied with the results of prior patients' before-and-after photos? 
Which dental technology (lasers, caries detection devices, CAD/CAM restoration, intraoral imaging, etc.) are in use, and how may they assist the practice in better serving your needs?
What sedation dentistry, spa treatments, or other calming amenities does the clinic offer to its patients so that they may rest and feel more at ease throughout their dental treatment?
When a patient has an emergency, who provides the service? Should we talk over the phone or meet in person instead? Find out what kind of precautions the practice has in an emergency.
Finally, you choose a cosmetic dentist to change the look of your teeth and smile. It's a decision that's both personal and significant. Most operations are irreversible, so take your time, feel comfortable with the dentist, and trust their talents. When you do, you'll be thrilled with the treatment results.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Fixed Bridges</h2>
A dental bridge is a fixed (non-removable) appliance and is an excellent way to replace missing teeth.

There are several types of bridges. You and your dentist will discuss the best options for your particular case. The “traditional bridge” is the most popular type and is usually made of porcelain fused to metal. This type of bridge consists to two crowns that go over two anchoring teeth (abutment teeth) and are attached to pontics (artificial teeth), filling the gap created by one or more missing teeth.

Dental bridges are highly durable and will last many years, however they may need replacement or need to be re-cemented due to normal wear.Reasons for a fixed bridge:

Fill space of missing teeth.
<ul>
 	<li>Maintain facial shape.</li>
 	<li>Prevent remaining teeth from drifting out of position.</li>
 	<li>Restore chewing and speaking ability.</li>
 	<li>Restore your smile.</li>
 	<li>Upgrade from a removable partial denture to a permanent dental appliance</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Dentistry for Children</h1>
As soon as your kid reaches the age of one, you should begin scheduling their first dental appointment with a conventional dentist or a pediatric dentist.

Dental care for children from infancy through puberty is known as pediatric dentistry. In addition to promoting children's oral health, pediatric dentists function as educational resources for their patients' parents. Pediatric dentistry and pediatrics recommend that a child's first dental appointment occur after the first tooth's emergence or by the child's first birthday, respectively.

A patient's "dental home," as defined by the AAPD, is one in which the dentist and patient have a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship. Regular dental exams can help catch tooth decay in its earliest stages. Early identification is critical for maintaining oral health, modifying destructive behaviors, and the most effective and least invasive treatment. As part of the preventive home care program, parents receive a caries risk assessment, thumb and pacifier habits, and assistance in protecting children's mouths and teeth (brushing, flossing, and fluorides).
<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
Pediatric Dentist can offer:&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>A preventive and restorative approach to oral diseases.</li>
 	<li>Interpret x-rays and other diagnostic tests.</li>
 	<li>Formulate treatment strategies to restore the oral health of healthy and special needs pediatric patients.</li>
 	<li>Monitor dental growth.</li>
 	<li>Interceptive orthodontic treatment.</li>
 	<li>Perform dental surgical procedures if necessary.</li>
 	<li>Provide emergency care (dental infection, pain, and dental trauma).</li>
 	<li>Use various levels of sedation (minimal, moderate, or deep) and general anesthesia on young patients.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pediatric Dentist vs. General Dentist:</h2>
A general dentist and a pediatric dentist treat children, but a few key distinctions exist. To provide the most effective dental treatment for children, a pediatric dentist must have extensive training and experience in pediatric dentistry.
While a general dentist treats patients of all ages, they may also treat the entire family. A pediatric dentist may be necessary for certain families, but this is a convenient option that may save time and money for others.

You may want to think about sending your child to a pediatric dentist because of the many perks that come with it.
<ol>
 	<li>Proper Credentials: To specialize in pediatrics, students spend two or three more years in school. The study in child development, behavior, and special needs children helps them understand children and give services a conventional dentist may not.</li>
 	<li>Children Only: Pediatric dentists exclusively see 0-18-year-olds. Depending on the dentist, most see children of various ages. After 18, your youngster can see a general dentist.</li>
 	<li>Specialties-friendly: If your kid has a dental condition that only happens in childhood, such as thumb or finger sucking, using a pacifier, or other oral disorders, pediatric dentists can educate the parent on how to remedy the issue. Because they understand kid behavior, they may provide advice on excellent mouth and tooth growth.</li>
 	<li>Offices: Your youngster should be comfortable at the dentist. Some kids fear the dentist. While it's vital to prepare your child for their first and future dentist appointments, the clinic might be unsettling. Pediatric dentistry clinics are intended to put youngsters at ease. Toys, character decals, and pleasant personnel may be in the waiting room.</li>
 	<li>Parent-friendly: You may have questions regarding your child's teeth and development. Pediatric dentists will comprehend your questions from a different standpoint than a regular dentist. You can trust that they have your child's best interest in mind and know how to help them.</li>
 	<li>Educating the kid: Teaching a small child to brush isn't always easy. Brushing twice a day, eating nutritious meals, flossing if needed, etc. A pediatric dentist can assist your kid in comprehending dental care and education.</li>
 	<li>Needs: Ask about a pediatric dentist for special-needs children. They understand various particular needs and how to make patients more comfortable. Contact your pediatric dentistry practice if you have a kid with unique requirements.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>All on 4 and All on 6</h2>
Dental implants have transformed prosthodontics. In the All on 4 procedure, only four implants replace a whole arch, either on the upper or lower jaw. On top of these four implants, an entire arch of fixed teeth rests.
<h5>What You Need to Know:</h5>
Before placing the posts, your dentist will do a digital scan of your mouth and teeth to decide where they should go. They will also remove any sick or broken teeth from the arch.

The posts of All-on-4 implants are positioned at a 45-degree angle to promote stability and alleviate bone stress while biting and chewing. After drilling a tiny hole in the jawbone, the dentist secures 4 implants in it. With the help of small incisions in the gum tissue, the dentist exposes the jawbone. Abutments connect rods and implants and act as a link between them.

When all four implants are embedded in the patient's jaw, the preps for fitting the denture plate come next. After being attached to the abutments, the plate functions like natural teeth, and that is why there is no reason to make this plate removable.
<h5>All-on-4 vs. Conventional Dental Implants:</h5>
Dental implants are tiny titanium screws placed in the jawbone to support a single tooth or a teeth bridge. Implant-supported prosthetic teeth are fastened to the titanium post.

Conventional dental implant surgery requires 6-8 implants to support a complete fixed bridge. On the other hand, only two implants in the front of the mouth and two angled implants in the back support the whole arch.

The fundamental constraint of traditional complete arch tooth replacement is screwing rear implants into low-bone-density locations. The 45° implant avoids bone-deficient jaw regions.

All On 4 is less intrusive, so the healing and rehabilitation period is faster, and fewer implant fixings imply greater freedom in designing and fitting replacement teeth.
<h5>All-on-6 Dental Implant:</h5>
<h5>Procedure: What You Need to Know:</h5>
All-on-6 dental treatment is an excellent alternative to dentures if you have enough bone structure in your jaw. It serves as a foundation for a bridge or an over-denture. A permanent prosthesis gets the support of six dental implants to function.

The All-on-6 procedure is a version of the All-on-4 approach, except instead of four implants, it employs six implants put in areas of the mouth with the most bone volume. This procedure is an alternative to regular dental implants for patients with good bone structure since it optimizes bone potential. All on 6 is a better option than all on 4 since it provides excellent stability and strength to your jawline.

After 2 to 6 months, the final prosthesis will be installed, custom-made by the prosthetist based on 3-D scans taken during the patient's recovery, after the implants have fully integrated and healed.

Due to the uniform position of all 6 implants in the jaw, the patients feel well-balanced chewing force throughout the prosthesis. As long as the patient practices proper oral hygiene and takes care of the bridge, implant treatment should last 30 years.
Consequently, many of our patients believe that all six result in a more comfortable, tighter denture fit because the distribution of downward pressure while biting is more even.
<h5>After Care:</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Many patients have a sweet tooth, so it's essential to follow your dentist's dietary guidelines following an ALL-on-6 to reduce swelling and bleeding.</li>
 	<li>2 weeks: soups, smoothies, purées, yogurts, soufflés for gourmets, if not too hot or cold.&nbsp;</li>
 	<li>2 to 4 weeks: Pasta, grains, cereals, eggs, fish, vegetables, and soft fruits chopped finely are allowed.</li>
 	<li>1-2 months: tender meats, well-cooked veggies, excellent oven cooking.</li>
 	<li>2 months and beyond: moderate chewing can resume, and dietary restrictions are no longer essential.</li>
</ul>
<h5>- All on 4 orthodontic implants</h5>
It is an orthodontic procedure in which only four implants are used to replace missing teeth in the lower or upper set of teeth. These four Implants act as a support mechanism for the positioning of a set of fixed teeth.

In the All On 4 dental implants process, the rear implants are angled 45 degrees toward the back of the mouth and positioned in the anterior maxilla, an area of the jaw with a higher bone density. The dental implant is a small titanium screw, the screw is inserted into the jawbone. The purpose of the screw is to support a single tooth or a dental bridge. The replacement teeth are linked to the titanium implant, which serves as a basis. The titanium implant act as a foundation on which the replacement teeth are attached.

The development of the 45° angulated implant in All On 4 implants made it possible to insert the implant in bone-deficient areas of the jaw. Patients with osteoporosis can normally have the All on 4 surgeries because it eliminates the requirement for bone grafting unlike the old methods of dental implants.
In All On 4 implant, fewer implant fixtures are used for the replacement of teeth which makes this process less painful and intrusive, also the healing process is quicker.
<h5>- All 6 orthodontic implants</h5>
It is a full-mouth restoration technique that uses six implants. They act as anchors for the 14-unit bridge and are positioned in the lower or upper jaw. All on 6 implants are used on the patients who cannot use the prosthesis due to excessive bone loss.

These implants are biomechanically firm and easier to care for. All on 6 dental implants are manufactured from materials such as acrylic fused to titanium, monolithic zirconia, and porcelain accumulated to a cobalt-chromium frame.

The dentist thoroughly examines the patient's mouth before inserting the implants. The entire treatment takes about 2-3 hours, and it can be completed in a single day.

All 4 implants are more cost-effective due to the technique's effectiveness and stability. Patients with severe gum disease who require stronger bone support or whose bone is badly weakened choose this treatment. This procedure, like All-on-4, provides a quick answer with instant filling on the same day of surgery.

Benefits of All on 4 and All on 6 Dental implants:
<ul>
 	<li>Recovery time is short.</li>
 	<li>People can enjoy eating without pain and suffering.</li>
 	<li>Better smile</li>
 	<li>There's no need for dentures that can be taken out.</li>
 	<li>People who get the implants can bite and chew food just like they would with their natural teeth.</li>
 	<li>These implants are solutions that will last a lifetime.</li>
 	<li>Dental implants are a long-term replacement for lost teeth.</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Implant Supported Bridges and Dentures</h2>		
		A denture is a removable dental appliance replacement for missing teeth and surrounding tissue		
		<p>They are made to closely resemble your natural teeth and may even enhance your smile. There are two types of dentures - complete and partial dentures. Complete dentures are used when all of the teeth are missing, while partial dentures are used when some natural teeth remain. A Partial denture not only fills in the spaces created by missing teeth, it prevents other teeth from shifting. A Complete denture may be either “conventional” or “immediate.” A conventional type is made after the teeth have been removed and the gum tissue has healed, usually taking 4 to 6 weeks. During this time the patient will go without teeth. Immediate dentures are made in advance and immediately placed after the teeth are removed, thus preventing the patient from having to be without teeth during the healing process. Once the tissues shrink and heal, adjustments will have to be made.

What are Dental Crowns?<p>A dental crown is a long-term remedy since it covers and cements the visible portion of the tooth. Crowns act like a cap that covers a tooth’s visible section.</p>Purpose:<ul><li>One of the primary purposes is to improve a tooth’s aesthetics while also improving its strength, usefulness, form, and size.</li><li>Bridges can maintain their position with the assistance of Crowns.</li><li>A crown is employed to secure the top of a dental implant.</li><li>If you’ve had root canal therapy, you should consider getting a crown to protect your site.</li></ul>Necessity:<ul><li>To prevent a weaker or broken tooth from fracturing by keeping it together.</li><li>To replace a broken, outdated filling.</li><li>To repair a fractured tooth.</li><li>When teeth have been worn down, it is necessary to extend them (for example, from grinding).</li><li>To support a tooth with an ample filling and little natural tooth structure.</li><li>To modify for aesthetic purposes, such as filling gaps between teeth or reshaping or rotating teeth.</li></ul>Onlays & ¾ Crowns:For your teeth, there are a variety of crowns available. Onlays and 3/4 crowns cover fewer teeth than regular crowns. A typical crown will completely encircle your tooth, allowing you to eat and speak normally. You may want to consider Onlays and 3/4 crowns if you have a healthy tooth structure, as it covers only a part of your tooth. To prepare the tooth for a crown, your dentist will scrape away the decayed or damaged enamel only and then reshape the tooth. Types:Different types of Dental Crowns are now available, which gives variety in functionality and appearance. However, your dentist will consider a few factors like crown placement, tooth visibility, gum tissue condition, and how much the dentist can save the original tooth before suggesting a specific type of dental crown.What are Dental Bridges:A dental bridge replaces lost natural teeth with prosthetic teeth composed of resin or porcelain. As the name implies, a bridge connects crowns on each side of a gap in the mouth to support prosthetic tooth replacement. The crown covers two or more teeth to attach the Bridge and artificial teeth. If you don’t have natural teeth, your dentist may propose implanting teeth on either side.Necessity:<p>Missing teeth influence you in many ways. A dental bridge can help with:</p><ul><li>teeth-whitening</li><li>improving chewing</li><li>speech restoration</li><li>maintaining your face’s contour</li><li>readjusting your bite to disperse chewing power</li><li>preventing teeth from shifting from the correct location.</li></ul>Care:Alternatives to Dental Bridges include Dentures and Dental Implants, albeit the best option for a particular patient will vary. Five to seven years is the average life expectancy of dental bridges. With proper dental care and regular expert cleanings, more than ten years may be possible. Flossing is crucial for maintaining your Bridge. Once-a-day flossing is the best approach to cleaning a bridge’s bottom. When flossing a bridge, you must floss around your natural teeth and between the Bridge and gums.Types:Traditional Fixed Bridge: with two or more crowns and filler teeth in between.
Cantilever Bridge: with abutment teeth on one side. Resin-Bonded Bridge: Different material for missing tooth on front.
Implant-supported Bridge: dental implants in place of abutment teeth.Which Is Better for You: a Dental Crown or a Bridge?<ul><li>Traditional Fixed Bridge: with two or more crowns and filler teeth in between.</li><li>Cantilever Bridge: with abutment teeth on one side.

There are two types of dentures - complete and partial dentures. Complete dentures are used when all of the teeth are missing, while partial dentures are used when some natural teeth remain.

A Complete denture may be either \u201cconventional\u201d or \u201cimmediate.\u201d A conventional type is made after the teeth have been removed and the gum tissue has healed, usually taking 4 to 6 weeks. During this time the patient will go without teeth. Immediate dentures are made in advance and immediately placed after the teeth are removed, thus preventing the patient from having to be without teeth during the healing process.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Dental Cleaning</h1>		
		To avoid tooth decay and gum diseases, to get a dental exam and cleaning every six months are advised.		
		<p>Dental examinations and professional teeth cleanings will help your dentist evaluate the health of your teeth and gums. This also eliminates many germs from the mouth since bacteria reside in plaque and tartar.</p>
<p>Dentist appointments are dreaded by many. It's easy to see why they're worried, the poking, the unusual noises, and the occasional jaw soreness. However, most people don't feel any discomfort regarding tooth cleanings. When you're well-informed about the procedure, it's easier to relax and take pleasure in the fresh, minty effects of Professional Dental Cleaning.</p>		
			<h2>Dental Examination: </h2>		
		A dental hygienist performs the vast majority of cleanings. Before cleaning, they do a full mouth evaluation. Gingivitis (inflamed gums) and other dental issues can be spotted by a dental hygienist using a tiny mirror. The dental hygienist may call the dentist if they identify serious concerns and need to know if it's safe to proceed.		
			<h1>Plaque and Tartar Removal: </h1>		
		With a tiny mirror to help them, the dental hygienist uses a scaler to remove plaque and tartar from your gum line and teeth. Despite the sound of scratching, it's natural. The greater the tartar in your mouth, the longer it will take to scrape a particular area.
Brushing and Flossing regularly prevent plaque from accumulating and hardening into tartar by brushing and flossing regularly. The takeaway for those who dread it is to brush and floss more frequently.
			<h1>High-powered electric brush cleaning:</h1>		
		With a tiny mirror to help them, the dental hygienist uses a scaler to remove plaque and tartar from your gum line and teeth. Despite the sound of scratching, it's natural. The greater the tartar in your mouth, the longer it will take to scrape a particular area.
Brushing and Flossing regularly prevent plaque from accumulating and hardening into tartar by brushing and flossing regularly. The takeaway for those who dread it is to brush and floss more frequently.
			<h1>Professional Flossing:</h1>		
		Whether or not you floss regularly, a skilled flossing session is the best. If you have gum bleeding, your dental hygienist can find the source of the problem by probing deep between your teeth. Through Professional Flossing, your teeth eliminate leftover plaque or toothpaste from the cleaning process.		
			<h1>Rinsing & fluoride treatment:</h1>		
		<p>To proceed further, the dentist will ask you to rinse your mouth to remove particles, preferably with a fluoride liquid. Finally, a fluoride treatment completes the cleaning procedure, protecting teeth against cavities for months. <br />The frothy gel (or sticky paste) is applied in a mouthpiece that fits over your teeth. For the most part, it's just left on your teeth for one minute. Besides the foamy gel, with the help of a little brush, fluoride varnish is applied to the teeth. Fluoride varnish hardens by coming in contact with saliva, so you may eat and drink immediately.</p>		
			<h1>Types of Professional Dental Cleaning: </h1>		
		<p>Depending on the quantity of tartar and plaque on your teeth, your dentist will conduct one of the four following dental cleanings:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Prophylaxis Dental Cleaning</b> is performed to keep healthy teeth free of decay and illness by removing plaque and tartar from their surfaces.</li>
<li><b>Scaling and Root Planning Cleaning</b>, also known as Deep cleaning, are performed on both the teeth and the gum pockets to cure gum disease or periodontitis and require multiple appointments.</li>
<li><b>Periodontal Maintenance Cleaning </b>is used in the treatment of gingivitis. The procedure removes plaque and tartar from the tooth surface, and gum pockets, then smooth the roots if needed. This type of cleaning is the most common practice because Gum disease progresses and worsens if not addressed.</li>
<li><b>Gross Debridement Cleaning </b>removes excessive plaque and tartar from teeth. Those patients who struggle to maintain an oral care regimen or have avoided the dentist for a long time should go for this cleaning. </li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Restorative Dentistry</h2>		
		Restorative dentistry focuses on repairing damaged or missing teeth. In addition to removing and repairing cavities, these dentists also treat various other oral diseases. They also specialize in treating individuals who need dental repairs due to trauma or injury.		
		Endodontics, prosthodontics, and periodontics are all included in this area of dentistry. Because many patients require complex care, they may require treatment from many specialists. Restoring the teeth's function is one objective, while restoring their aesthetics is the second, depending on the situation.		
			<h5>Significance:</h5>		
		<ul><li>Restorative treatments assist in keeping the teeth aligned by eliminating the gaps.</li><li>Replacing teeth helps maintain good dental hygiene and avoid plaque buildup.</li><li>Missing teeth impair health, looks, and self-esteem.</li><li>In addition to preserving teeth, restorative procedures can also restore the natural appearance, shape, and feel of a patient's smile by:</li><li>Damaged teeth get revived by using dental fillings or bonding.</li><li>Replacing lost tooth structure using restorations like inlays, onlays, crowns, or fillings.</li><li>Completely replacing lost teeth using artificial restorations, such as dental implants, bridges, or dentures.</li></ul>		
			<h5>Type of Treatments:</h5>		
			<h5>Crowns:</h5>		
		A crown is the best option for those who have fractured or decayed teeth. A crown resembles the form of an actual tooth. Strengthening and protecting your teeth is the primary purpose of this procedure. A skilled professional creates the crown in a dental lab after your dentist prepares the tooth and takes an imprint. Finally, the dentist cements the crown to the injured tooth.		
			<h5>Dental Implants:</h5>		
		When a person loses a tooth, dental implants are an option. A dental implant mimics the appearance and feel of a natural tooth. Implants have a metal anchor and an artificial tooth, like a crown. The anchor made up of titanium acts like a tooth's root inside the jawbone. Following the insertion of the anchor, an artificial tooth sits on top of the inserted Implant.		
			<h5>Dental Bridges:</h5>		
		<p>Dental bridges are restorations that encompass three or more teeth completely. Unlike dental implants, which may replace an entire row of teeth, two natural teeth are needed to "bridge the gap" on either side of a lost one. Bridges are required when severe dental disease, lost teeth, or extractions are the case. </p><p>Dental bridges are less expensive than implants and need less healing time, but they do not have the same natural appearance. Additionally, they are more likely to break or deteriorate than implants are.</p>		
			<h5>Cavity Fillings:</h5>		
		In terms of restorative dentistry, dental fillings are the most prevalent. Fillings can last several years and look and operate like a natural tooth placed by an experienced dentist, using suitable materials and techniques.		
			<h5>Dentures:</h5>		
		<p>When a person loses multiple teeth in a single bite, dentures are the best option to replace them. In complete tooth loss due to gum disease or advanced dental decay, a set of bespoke dentures is a standard treatment.</p><p>Patients can pick from five varieties of dentures. These include complete dentures, fixed or removable partial dentures, implant-retained dentures, and immediate dentures.  </p>		
			<h5>Composite Bonding:</h5>		
		You can employ composite bonding to correct cosmetic issues such as broken, chipped, or yellowed teeth. In contrast to crowns and veneers, this procedure involves the removal of just a little portion of the natural tooth. Complex material is chemically bonded to your teeth during the treatment.		
			<h5>Inlays and Onlays:</h5>		
		Inlays and Onlays are partial restorations made of tooth-colored material or gold that replace tiny sections of missing or damaged teeth. They are less intrusive than crowns and use indirect restorative materials.		
			<h5>Restorative dentistry tips:</h5>		
		<p><ul><li>Two times every day, properly brush your teeth.</li><li>Brushing your teeth with an electric toothbrush can help you get rid of plaque while also doing some restorative work.</li><li>Floss daily around your teeth, dental implants, crowns, and bridges.</li><li>Avoid chewing on meals that are too firm or sticky. These can damage implants, bridges, and crowns.</li><li>The use of an antibacterial mouthwash can help battle plaque bacteria surrounding restorative work.</li></ul></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Surgical Dentistry
</h1>		
		Dental health difficulties can occur at any age, although not all operations arise from oral health disorders. Dentists send patients to oral surgeons before recommending dental surgery. To figure out the best course of action, this person will evaluate the problem and your dental health. In some circumstances, oral surgeons may propose nonsurgical therapies, depending on the severity of your disease.
			<h2>Surgical Dentistry
</h2>		
		When a dentist suggests dental surgery, people often panic, fearing that it will be a painful and costly treatment. Many individuals don't understand that dental surgery is relatively frequent and treats common diseases. For the most part, dental surgery is considered an outpatient treatment, and patients may often resume regular activity within a few days. 		
			<h2>Is Dental Surgery for You? </h2>		
		Dental health difficulties can occur at any age, although not all operations arise from oral health disorders. Dentists send patients to oral surgeons before recommending dental surgery. To figure out the best course of action, this person will evaluate the problem and your dental health. In some circumstances, oral surgeons may propose nonsurgical therapies, depending on the severity of your disease.
			<h2>Pediatricav Dentist vs. General Dentist:</h2>		
		The most frequent forms of dental surgery are operations that are so normal that many individuals may not even consider it dental surgery, such as teeth extraction or whitening. Following are some procedures that count as Dental Surgeries:
			<h2>Extraction: 
</h2>		
		Typically, the Extraction procedure is for troublesome, unhealthy, or redundant teeth. Pulling or cutting removes them. Teeth pulling is the simplest version of this type of dental surgery, and it is a regular procedure—local or general anesthesia works fine for this. 
A famous extraction procedure is when a Wisdom Tooth creates discomfort, and the dentist prescribes its extraction. 
			<h2>Root Canal:
</h2>		
		One of the most prevalent types of dental surgery is the root canal. Root canals are painless and highly effective. Having an infected pulp under the tooth’s hard enamel can cause discomfort in your teeth, neck, and jaw. An oral surgeon can remove the infected pulp and replace it with a filling or crown.
			<h2>Crowns: 
</h2>		
		<p>These dental prosthetics are created from biocompatible materials, such as tin, gold, aluminum, CMC/PMC, etc. Compared to tooth fillings, dental surgery for the teeth provides a more durable tooth covering (which breaks easily). A crown might be used on a dead, cracking tooth or one that needs a root canal, though it requires reshaping the natural tooth.</p>		
			<h2>Dental implants:
</h2>		
		Dental implants replace one or more lost teeth permanently. Titanium screws replace the roots and support the new dental crown on top of it. Before putting tooth restorations, the jawbone is allowed to grow around the metal root. This surgery can take around six months.
			<h2>Bridge: 
</h2>		
		<p>Teeth shift and migrate toward the opening when one or more are removed, resulting in an altered bite, usually recovered by Bridges. This type of dental prosthesis might be employed to save or preserve your bite following an extraction.<br />Two or more crowns are attached to one other and support the dental bridge in between. A dentist reshapes the adjacent teeth to put crowns on both ends of the bridge.</p>		
			<h2>Dental bone graft:
</h2>		
		Jawbone loss requires a dental bone graft. Bone grafts prevent tooth movement and give a stable base, keeping teeth healthy. A dental bone graft restores jawbone volume and density for dental implants.
			<h2>Cosmetic Procedures: 
</h2>		
		The patient's face or smile is enhanced through Cosmetic surgery. Cosmetic operations include tooth whitening, orthodontics, and combinations like veneers, bonding, or composite repair to treat discolored teeth; some patients appreciate having their teeth shaped through filing. 
			<h2>Cleft lip and palate repair:
</h2>		
		Cleft lip babies have a hole in their upper lip, whereas cleft palate babies have an opening in their mouth. Some newborns have both. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons fix cleft lips and palates to restore normal eating and speaking.
			<h2>Corrective Jaw Surgery
</h2>		
		This procedure corrects jaw bone defects, improves, corrects the misalignment, and addresses facial abnormalities. Corrective jaw surgery relieves TMJ dysfunction (TMD).
			<h2>Periodontics: 
</h2>		
		This field of dentistry treats gum and periodontal illnesses such as gingivitis and periodontitis. Periodontal disease begins with gingivitis and gum bleeding before becoming periodontitis.
Periodontitis can loosen teeth and destroy the tooth-gum-bone link. Periodontal therapies include dental implants, laser, gum graft surgery, thorough cleaning, crown lengthening, and cosmetic surgery.
			<h2>Final words: 
</h2>		
		Dental surgery includes several treatments that don't involve a knife or gum cutting. Anyhow, any surgery, including dental surgery, is serious. Modern surgical technologies enable your surgeon to give less intrusive care, unless necessary.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Orthodontics </h2>		
		<p>An alternative to conventional braces, Invisalign® is a system of transparent aligners that straightens your teeth over time.</p>		
			<h2>Orthodontics:
</h2>		
		Orthodontics:
Orthodontics is a dental specialty. It refers to the treatment of crooked teeth and malocclusions. An orthodontist is a dental specialist who works to straighten patients' teeth. The orthodontist may correct similar with teeth, jaws, and face as well. Treatment can be aesthetic, but it's also common to focus on improving a patient's dental health.
			<h5>Benefits:
</h5>		
		In addition to enhancing one's looks, orthodontic treatment provides further advantages. Improved self-esteem, improved chewing, clearer pronunciation and speech, reduced risk of dental caries, and lowered risk of gum damage and trauma from overbites and malocclusions are all significant benefits of orthodontic treatment. However, in some circumstances, treatment can lead to enhanced eating and speaking performance and assist in safeguarding teeth from injury or decay. — Medical and dental equipment such as headgear, plates, and braces help orthodontists achieve their objectives.
			<h5>Treatment Approach:
</h5>		
		Orthodontic therapy is often not initiated until most of a child's adult teeth have erupted. As a general rule, this occurs around 12 years old. There are fewer alternatives for orthodontic treatment for adults, but they can begin at any age. However, the number of adult teeth a child has erupted and the development of their face and jaws play a role in this.
Because orthodontic therapy can raise your risk of tooth decay and gum disease, you won't be able to begin treatment unless you maintain a high level of oral hygiene. Many appliances are used in orthodontic therapy to retrain muscles, slowly reposition teeth, and influence jaw growth by gently pressing teeth and jaw together.
			<h5>Aims: 
</h5>		
		Orthodontics can help treat a variety of dental issues, including:
Crowding: Poor alignment or crowding of teeth that are larger than the mouth's capacity results in an unappealing look and a bad bite. The upper canine teeth are the most typical to overlap.
Open Bite: When the bottom two front teeth do not touch the top two front teeth at any point while chewing results in an inability to chew properly.
Deep Overbite: The bottom teeth are so far forward in a deep bite that they contact the roof of the mouth, leading to damage to the gums and palate. Gum disease and tooth loss are possible consequences of this.
Crossbite: When the teeth's ends do not connect in a crossbite. It causes terrible looks, difficulty eating, and erodible teeth.
Increased Overjet: Thumb- or finger-sucking can cause this issue, which is an extension of the top teeth. The uneven development of the jawbone may be to blame.
Reverse Overjet: When the lower jaw extends beyond the upper jaw. In addition to a deficient physical look, it can cause tooth wear.
Spacing: Poorly formed, undersized, or absent teeth can cause gaps between teeth that appear unnatural.
			<h5>Orthodontic appliances:
</h5>		
		Appliances are used in orthodontic therapy to realign teeth. Following are the four most common options in practice:
Braces attached to the front of the teeth using brackets and wires are fixed braces.
Detachable Braces, which are plastic plates that attach to the teeth using clips, are restricted to minor tooth movements.
Removable Plastic Braces that fit both the upper and lower teeth and are linked together or intended to work together.
Other appliances may include headgear, aligners, invisible or lingual braces, lip and cheek bumpers, palatal expander splints, jaw repositioning appliances, etc. Ask your orthodontist which one of these will help your condition.
			<h5>Retainers: 
</h5>		
		When orthodontic treatment is complete, retainer comes into play. They keep teeth in their new positions while the gums and bones around them heal. They can either be detachable or permanent.
Your teeth may shift if you don't use your retainer anymore. It is typical for the location of your teeth to change during your lifetime. Wearing a retainer as instructed is the only method to ensure that your teeth remain straight.
			<h5>Clear Aligners/Invisalign®:
</h5>		
		<p>As an alternative to metal braces, Invisalign® is a transparent aligner system that is practically invisible, hence the name 'clear.' They're great for individuals with minor dental concerns or those who don't want to wear traditional braces.<br />It is possible to straighten your teeth with transparent, robust, medical-grade, non-toxic plastic aligners that are custom-made to fit you. "Invisible" aligners are used to shift the position of your teeth gently. Without the need for metal braces, this procedure corrects misalignment.</p>		
			<h5>Conclusion: 
</h5>		
		There are a wide variety of orthodontic procedures available. The optimal treatment for you will depend on the specific condition you are dealing with. Evaluating your existing dental situation and predicting how it will evolve is the first step in any procedure. Orthodontists use diagnostic techniques, including clinical examinations, dental models made of plastic, and X-rays, to establish a treatment plan which may offer several solutions to your situation.
It is understandable there is a lot to consider when deciding on a treatment plan for orthodontics. However, now that you understand what orthodontics is, why it's necessary, and how it works, we hope you're on your way to benefiting from it!

Gum disease and tooth loss are possible consequences of this.\nCrossbite: When the teeth's ends do not connect in a crossbite. It causes terrible looks, difficulty eating, and erodible teeth.\nIncreased Overjet: Thumb- or finger-sucking can cause this issue, which is an extension of the top teeth.
